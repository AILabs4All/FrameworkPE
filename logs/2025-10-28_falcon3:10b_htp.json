We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

    "response": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED\n\nExplanation: The incident description mentions a vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code and obtain unauthorized access to user accounts. This scenario directly relates to the potential for data leaks, as attackers could potentially steal sensitive information from these compromised accounts. Therefore, the category of \"Data Leak\" (CAT4) is justified.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED\n\nExplanation: The incident does not primarily focus on unauthorized access to sensitive data without mentioning a vulnerability that could lead to such leaks. Instead, it describes a situation where attackers could exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access and execute code, which is more indicative of a vulnerability exploitation (CAT5) rather than a direct data leak. However, since the potential for data leaks exists due to the unauthorized access, the false hypothesis is not supported.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:\n\nCategory: CAT4\nExplanation: The incident description indicates a potential for data leaks due to the vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive information. Therefore, the most appropriate category is \"Data Leak\" (CAT4).",

Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nPossuir um roteador com serviço BGP acessível para qualquer IP via\n   Internet aumenta os riscos de uma negação de serviço contra o\n   serviço BGP de sua rede.  Idealmente o serviço BGP de um roteador\n   deveria estar acessível apenas para os roteadores que necessitem\n   estabelecer uma sessão BGP com este equipamento.\n\n2. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nRecomenda-se que sejam implementadas ACLs para que o serviço BGP\n   seja acessível somente aos roteadores que necessitem estabelecer\n   uma sessão BGP com este equipamento.\n\nEstas ACLs devem ser configuradas conforme descrito na seção\n   \"Protection of the BGP Speaker\" do documento:\n\n- RFC 7454: BGP Operations and Security\n     [URL_135fcdbf96]\n\n- No caso de equipamentos Juniper, consulte:\n     TCP Access Restriction for BGP\n     [URL_cc7733d47b]\n\n- No caso de equipamentos Cisco, consulte:\n     Protecting Border Gateway Protocol for the Enterprise, Section Infrastructure ACLs\n     [URL_06dd6bd3f2]\n\n3.
