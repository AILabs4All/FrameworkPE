We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_2002177763])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems.

Por se tratar de um serviço utilizado apenas dentro \n  de redes locais, não é necessário que o serviço mDNS esteja exposto \n  à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n  ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com mDNS retorna uma resposta muito maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço mDNS pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de\n  implicar em um consumo de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nSe o serviço mDNS não for utilizado na sua rede desabilite o serviço no\n  seu dispositivo.

Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com SNMP retorna uma resposta muito maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço SNMP pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de\n  implicar em um consumo de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nSe o SNMP não for utilizado na sua rede desabilite o serviço no seu\n  dispositivo. Se o recurso for utilizado na rede local, configure-o\n  de modo que esteja disponível apenas para a rede local.\n\nEvite utilizar comunidades public e se possível utilize autenticação\n  quando disponível.\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  SNMP para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n    [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um dispositivo vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de dispositivos\n  que usam SNMP que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n  ataques distribuídos de negação de serviços (DDoS).  O [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está\n  notificando os responsáveis pelos dispositivos brasileiros presentes\n  nestas listas.\n\n* Como posso ter certeza que resolvi o problema?\n\nVocê pode verificar seu dispositivo atravás dos seguintes comandos:\n  (preferencialmente execute-os a partir da Internet, ou seja, fora de\n  uma rede interna que tenha permissão de acesso ao dispositivo).\n\n$ snmpget -v 2c]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n         \n        If classification is not possible, return:\n        Category: Unknown\n        Explanation: Unknown\n        \n        OUTPUT:\n        Category: [NIST code]\n        Explanation: [Justification for the chosen category]\n        ",
