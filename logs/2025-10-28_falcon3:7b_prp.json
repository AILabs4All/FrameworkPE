This behavior suggests that someone is trying to gain access to the system using invalid credentials, which aligns with the characteristics of an Insider Abuse scenario (CAT6). The logs indicate multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address, suggesting a targeted attack on the SSH service. While the logs do not explicitly state that this is an insider, the nature of the attack—repeatedly trying to authenticate with invalid credentials—fits within the broader category of Insider Abuse, where internal users or those with access to the network might be attempting unauthorized actions.",

    "response": "### Incident Classification\n\n**Category:** CAT1\n\n**Explanation:** The incident described involves unauthorized access to user accounts, specifically through repeated attempts to authenticate with invalid usernames. This is evident from the log entries showing multiple instances of \"Invalid user\" and \"Failed password\" for various IP addresses. These actions align with the definition of Account Compromise (CAT1), where unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts occurs. The logs indicate that an attacker is trying to gain access to the system by attempting to authenticate as different users, which is a classic example of account compromise.\n\n**Justification:** The logs provided clearly show repeated attempts to log in with invalid usernames, indicating an active brute force attack on the SSH service. This behavior directly corresponds to the examples given for CAT1, such as credential phishing and SSH brute force. The attacker's actions are focused on gaining unauthorized access to accounts, which is the core characteristic of account compromise. Therefore, this incident falls under the category of Account Compromise (CAT1).",

    "response": "### Solution:\n\n**Category:** CAT6 - Insider Abuse\n\n**Explanation:** The incident described involves unauthorized access to user accounts, specifically through attempts to log in with invalid usernames. This behavior is indicative of an insider abuse scenario, where someone is trying to gain unauthorized access to the system. While the exact identity of the insider is not clear from the logs (as it's an IP address), the actions taken (repeated failed login attempts with different invalid usernames) suggest a deliberate attempt to compromise accounts. This aligns with the definition of CAT6, which includes malicious actions by internal users or those with legitimate access who misuse their privileges.\n\n**Justification:** The logs show repeated attempts to log in with invalid usernames, indicating an active and targeted effort to gain unauthorized access. This behavior is characteristic of insider abuse, where individuals exploit their knowledge of the system to attempt unauthorized access. The fact that these attempts are made from a specific IP address further suggests a focused insider threat rather than a random brute force attack.\n\n**NIST Code:** CAT6 - Insider Abuse",

The report includes log lines indicating attempts to send emails, which were filtered and rejected due to the sender's address triggering a filter. This scenario fits into the category of \"Intrusion Attempt\" (CAT12) because it describes an unconfirmed attack or attempt to gain unauthorized access or perform actions on a system. The logs and the process of filtering and rejecting the email suggest that this was an attempt to send potentially malicious content, but it was intercepted before any harm could be done. The fact that the incident is being reported and forwarded to appropriate contacts indicates that it is under investigation, aligning with the nature of CAT12 incidents.",

The report includes log lines detailing attempts to send emails through the organization's mail server.

The report includes log lines detailing attempts to send emails through the organization's mail server. These logs show multiple failed connection attempts and rejections due to various filters, indicating an intrusion attempt.\n\nThe key indicators here are:\n- Multiple failed connection attempts (CONNECT and DISCONNECT) from the same IP address.\n- Rejection of emails due to sender address triggers (smtp-amavis).\n- No successful delivery of emails, suggesting the attempts were unsuccessful.\n\nThese actions align with an Intrusion Attempt (CAT12), as they involve unconfirmed attacks or attempts to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious activities without success. The lack of a successful exploitation or compromise in this case further supports the classification under CAT12.\n\n### Text Substitution:\nHere's how the text would look after replacing all occurrences of 'scan' with 'X':\n\n```\n[target]: [[DATE_TIME_b2ba788c4e] 16:42 CERT.br: \nData de envio: Mar 18, 2022 4:39 PM\nPara: [EMAIL_ADDRESS_f6f7086365], [EMAIL_ADDRESS_53f32c8dbd], [EMAIL_ADDRESS_a0a85d701e]\nCC: [EMAIL_ADDRESS_83824c64b2]\nAssunto: Re: Abuse from [IP_ADDRESS_984299dc8f]\n\nHello,\n\nCERT.br works as a coordinating team for incidents and abuses related\nto Brazilian networks.

This suggests that the initial report was generated by automated processes within the organization, likely indicating an internal system or process handling security incidents. The fact that the message is forwarded to external entities like CERT.br implies that there might be an internal user or system component that is not properly configured or monitored, leading to the exposure of potentially sensitive information. This scenario aligns with CAT6 (Insider Abuse), as it involves actions by internal users or systems that could be considered malicious or inappropriate. The forwarding of the incident report to external entities without proper authorization or oversight could be seen as an insider abuse if the internal processes are not secure or if there is a lack of appropriate controls in place.",

    "response": "### Category: CAT1\n### Explanation:\nThe incident described involves unauthorized access to a machine, which is likely due to an attack on the SSH service. This fits the definition of Account Compromise under NIST's categorization, as it involves unauthorized access to a user or administrator account. The logs indicate multiple connections from the same IP address, suggesting a brute force attack on the SSH service, which is a common method for compromising accounts.\n\n#### Justification:\nThe email notification explicitly mentions that the machine in question is performing activities that are likely malicious, possibly due to compromise.

    "response": "### Category: CAT1 (Account Compromise)\n\n### Explanation:\nThe incident described involves logs showing activities that suggest unauthorized access to a machine, indicating an account compromise. The message from the CERT.br explicitly mentions that the machine is performing malicious activities, possibly due to it being compromised or used by someone involved in illicit actions.

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An IPTV device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.\n\nThis is]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n         \n        If classification is not possible, return:\n        Category: Unknown\n        Explanation: Unknown\n        \n        OUTPUT:\n        Category: [NIST code]\n        Explanation: [Justification for the chosen category]\n        ",

The BGP service is exposed to the Internet, which increases the risk of attacks such as volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS). This exposure makes the systems vulnerable to denial of service, where an attacker could attempt to make the BGP service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic. The recommendation to implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict access to the BGP service further underscores the concern about potential DoS attacks. Therefore, this incident aligns with the category of Denial of Service Attack (CAT3).",
