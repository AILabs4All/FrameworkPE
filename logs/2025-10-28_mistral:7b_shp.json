These attempts are being detected and logged by Fail2Ban, which suggests that these are brute force attacks. However, since the authentication attempts have been consistently denied, it is not clear if the attacker was successful in gaining unauthorized access. Therefore, this incident can be classified as an Intrusion Attempt (CAT12). The justification for this classification is that while the attacker's intentions are evident, the success of their attempt remains uncertain.",

These attempts are being flagged as potential abuse by the Fail2Ban system, which is designed to identify and block brute force attacks. However, since no successful login has been reported yet, it cannot be definitively confirmed that this is an account compromise (CAT1) or a social engineering attack (CAT7). Therefore, the most appropriate category for this incident would be CAT12: Intrusion Attempt. This classification indicates that there was an unconfirmed attempt to gain unauthorized access to the system through brute force SSH attacks. The next steps should involve further investigation and analysis of the logs, as well as implementing measures to strengthen the security of the targeted accounts and systems against such attacks.",

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An IPTV device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation.

Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nPossuir um roteador com serviço BGP acessível para qualquer IP via\n   Internet aumenta os riscos de uma negação de serviço contra o\n   serviço BGP de sua rede.  Idealmente o serviço BGP de um roteador\n   deveria estar acessível apenas para os roteadores que necessitem\n   estabelecer uma sessão BGP com este equipamento.\n\n2. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nRecomenda-se que sejam implementadas ACLs para que o serviço BGP\n   seja acessível somente aos roteadores que necessitem estabelecer\n   uma sessão BGP com este equipamento.\n\nEstas ACLs devem ser configuradas conforme descrito na seção\n   \"Protection of the BGP Speaker\" do documento:\n\n- RFC 7454: BGP Operations and Security\n     [URL_135fcdbf96]\n\n- No caso de equipamentos Juniper, consulte:\n     TCP Access Restriction for BGP\n     [URL_cc7733d47b]\n\n- No caso de equipamentos Cisco, consulte:\n     Protecting Border Gateway Protocol for the Enterprise, Section Infrastructure ACLs\n     [URL_06dd6bd3f2]\n\n3.

These attempts are likely part of a brute force attack, where an attacker tries multiple password combinations to gain unauthorized access. However, since the authentication attempts were unsuccessful, it cannot be definitively confirmed that the account was compromised.

While these attempts were unsuccessful, they indicate an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the system, which falls under the category of Intrusion Attempt (CAT12). The failed password attempts suggest that the attacker may have been using brute force or dictionary attacks to guess valid credentials for the targeted accounts. It is important to investigate and strengthen the security measures in place to prevent further such attempts.",
