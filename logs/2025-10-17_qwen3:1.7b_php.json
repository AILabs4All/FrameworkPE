    "response": "\n\nCategory: CAT12  \nExplanation: The incident involves multiple failed SSH login attempts from the same IP address ([IP_ADDRESS_b29a075d57]) to unauthorized systems. The logs indicate brute-force attacks (e.g., repeated failed password attempts) targeting non-privileged accounts. This aligns with **Intrusion Attempt** (CAT12), as the attacker is attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems, even though the attempts are unsuccessful. The activity reflects a reconnaissance phase of an unconfirmed attack, consistent with the description of failed login attempts. \n\n**Justification**: The key evidence is the repeated failed SSH authentication attempts, which are hallmark indicators of brute-force attacks. While the attempt is unsuccessful, the behavior itself qualifies as an intrusion attempt (CAT12) due to the unauthorized access effort. No malware or system disruption is present, and the incident does not involve data exfiltration or physical access.",

Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com SNMP retorna uma resposta muito maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço SNMP pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de\n  implicar em um consumo de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nSe o SNMP não for utilizado na sua rede desabilite o serviço no seu\n  dispositivo. Se o recurso for utilizado na rede local, configure-o\n  de modo que esteja disponível apenas para a rede local.\n\nEvite utilizar comunidades public e se possível utilize autenticação\n  quando disponível.\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  SNMP para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n    [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um dispositivo vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de dispositivos\n  que usam SNMP que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n  ataques distribuídos de negação de serviços (DDoS).

    "response": "\n\nCategory: CAT10  \nExplanation: The incident involves the misuse of the SNMP service (UDP) on vulnerable devices, which is a form of unauthorized resource consumption for potential DDoS attacks. The service is configured to be open and accessible to the public, allowing amplification attacks. This aligns with **CAT10 (Misuse of Resources)** as the service is being exploited for non-intended purposes (e.g., amplification attacks), violating security policies and risking resource misuse. The alert requests configuration changes to prevent such misuse, directly addressing the category's definition of unauthorized resource usage.",
