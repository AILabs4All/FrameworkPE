Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com SNMP retorna uma resposta muito maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço SNMP pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de\n  implicar em um consumo de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nSe o SNMP não for utilizado na sua rede desabilite o serviço no seu\n  dispositivo. Se o recurso for utilizado na rede local, configure-o\n  de modo que esteja disponível apenas para a rede local.\n\nEvite utilizar comunidades public e se possível utilize autenticação\n  quando disponível.\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  SNMP para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n    [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um dispositivo vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de dispositivos\n  que usam SNMP que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n  ataques distribuídos de negação de serviços (DDoS).

    "response": "The incident involves a denial-of-service attack. \n\n**Explanation:**\nThe logs indicate that malicious activities were detected through SSH connections. Denials of service attacks often occur when attackers exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols, causing excessive resource consumption or disruption. The logs show multiple messages, each indicating unauthorized access to systems, suggesting the use of SSH (which is insecure and can be exploited). This aligns with a Denial of Service Attack as the incident likely disrupted services due to high loads from the attackers.\n\n**Categorization:** CAT3",

Denials of service attacks often occur when attackers exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols, causing excessive resource consumption or disruption. The logs show multiple messages, each indicating unauthorized access to systems, suggesting the use of SSH (which is insecure and can be exploited). This aligns with a Denial of Service Attack as the incident likely disrupted services due to high loads from the attackers.\n\n**Categorization:** CAT3 The category is: CAT2 \n        If classification is not possible, return:\n        Category: Unknown\n        Explanation: Unknown\n        \n        OUTPUT:\n        Category: [NIST code]\n        Explanation: [Justification for the chosen category]\n        ",

The primary characteristic is Denial of Service, so **CAT3** (Denial of Service) is the most appropriate.",

    "response": "Category: CAT3  \nExplanation: The incident involves unauthorized access to a network using non-standard methods (SSH brute force) and patterns that resemble Denial of Service attacks, which falls under the Denial of Access category due to unauthorized modification.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Unauthorized Access:** The logs indicate unauthorized accesses through SSH brute force. This is an unauthorized method for accessing a network.\n\n2. **Recognize DDoS Patterns:** Multiple simultaneous incidents, each with a win value (e.g., 8192), suggest that the attack mechanisms are used to cause Denial of Service issues. This could mean multiple attacks or data breaches being conducted simultaneously.\n\n3. **Match to Denial of Access Category:** The pattern aligns with Denial of Access (CAT3) where unauthorized access is exploited further through DDoS techniques, bypassing traditional security measures by creating multiple simultaneous threats or exploiting vulnerabilities across systems.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The incident fits the Denial of Access category due to its focus on unauthorized modifications and potential DDoS attacks that disrupt network security without compromising user integrity.",

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP. Caso o serviço Portmap seja\n   desnecessário nesse servidor, recomendamos que ele seja desativado.\n\n4.

O [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está\n  notificando os responsáveis pelos dispositivos brasileiros presentes\n  nestas listas.\n\n* Como posso ter certeza que resolvi o problema?\n\nVocê pode verificar seu dispositivo atravás dos seguintes comandos:\n  (preferencialmente execute-os a partir da Internet, ou seja, fora de\n  uma rede interna que tenha permissão de acesso ao dispositivo).\n\n$ snmpget -v 2c]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n         **Classification of Incident Description:**\n- **Category:** CAT6 (Insider Abuse)\n- **Explanation:** The incident involves unauthorized access and use of IP addresses via SNMP testing. The presence of external device connections indicates that malicious actors may have been allowed into the system with proper authorization or, conversely, used improperly within a controlled environment without due process. This could lead to DDoS attacks affecting multiple devices collectively.\n\n**Classification Details:**\n1. **Problem Analysis:** External device connections not being blocked by SNMP suggest improper configuration allowing malicious access.\n2. **Contextual Factors:** IP addresses may be from devices intended for internal use, and the logs show multiple IPs used in DDoS attempts.\n3. **Possible Causes:** Unauthorized access or misuse of improperly configured systems without proper authorization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe incident likely involves unauthorized access or misuse within an authorized system, which could result in DDoS attacks affecting multiple users collectively through improper configuration.
