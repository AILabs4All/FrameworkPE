This situation highlights the importance of securing sensitive data and ensuring that only authorized individuals or systems have access to it. By compromising credentials through SSH, the malicious actors bypassed traditional security measures like firewalls and instead used automated tools (e.g., brute-force attacks) to gain unauthorized access. Replacing \"ransomware\" with a term related to account compromise maintains clarity in the context while preserving the intent of the classification. The substitution is appropriate because it aligns with the primary aspect of unauthorized access, making it both accurate and clear for someone reviewing the incident's classification.",
