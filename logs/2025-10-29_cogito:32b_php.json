The logs show repeated login failures using various usernames (\"test5\", \"rundeck\", \"jimmy\") and ultimately targeting the root account, which is characteristic of automated brute force attacks. While these are unauthorized access attempts, they have not yet resulted in successful compromise (which would be CAT1). Instead, this represents an ongoing intrusion attempt that was detected and reported by Fail2Ban, making it a clear example of an unconfirmed attack as defined under CAT12.",

The logs show multiple connection attempts and failed email delivery attempts, which are typical signs of unauthorized access attempts or potential spamming activities. While the attack was blocked (indicated by \"lost connection after DATA\"), this still falls under intrusion attempt category as it represents an unconfirmed but detected malicious activity. The fact that CERT.br is forwarding the abuse report to proper contacts also indicates this is being treated as a potential security incident rather than a confirmed breach, making CAT12 (Intrusion Attempt) the most appropriate classification.",

    "response": "Category: CAT12\n\nExplanation: This incident describes an intrusion attempt where an attacker (IP_ADDRESS_b29a075d57) is attempting to brute force SSH access by trying various usernames (cjl, kafka, cyr, sat, extrim, user1). The logs show multiple failed authentication attempts and invalid user logins. While this could potentially lead to a successful account compromise (CAT1), the incident as described only shows attempted attacks that were blocked or unsuccessful. Since these are unconfirmed attacks and no actual breach occurred, this falls under CAT12 - Intrusion Attempt. The key indicators are:\n- Multiple failed password attempts\n- Invalid user logins\n- Use of automated scanning tools (Fail2Ban mentioned)\n- No successful access achieved\n\nThis aligns with the NIST definition for CAT12 which includes examples like brute force attacks and blocked exploits, even if they don't result in a successful breach.",

    "response": "Category: CAT12\n\nExplanation: The incident described shows an intrusion attempt where a machine (IP_ADDRESS_f2e60f5baa) is attempting to establish connections to multiple MySQL servers on port 3306. This is evident from the log entries showing SYN packets being sent to various IP addresses with port 3306. While there's mention of a potential SSH brute force attack in the email, the actual logs provided show network scanning behavior targeting MySQL services. Since these are unconfirmed attacks (as indicated by the SYN packets and lack of successful connection establishment), this falls under CAT12: Intrusion Attempt - Unconfirmed Attacks. The CERT.br notification is alerting about suspicious activity that could be either a compromised machine or legitimate user misuse, but based on the provided logs, it's primarily showing network scanning behavior which fits best in the intrusion attempt category.",

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An IPTV device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation.

It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

The email contains several classic phishing indicators:\n\n1. It uses deceptive subject lines and sender information (\"Conta Digital dos seus serviços Vivo\")\n2. It attempts to impersonate a legitimate organization ([ORGANIZATION_42be1f53d6] Vivo)\n3. The message is part of an incident report about a PHISHING SCAM originating from IP [IP_ADDRESS_b7bfb2b94b]\n4. The email chain shows it was reported as a phishing attempt by another organization\n\nThe primary purpose of this communication appears to be reporting and investigating a social engineering attack where the attacker likely tried to deceive recipients into providing sensitive information or taking harmful actions under false pretenses. This aligns perfectly with the NIST definition of Social Engineering (CAT7), which includes deception tactics like phishing used to gain unauthorized access or data.",
