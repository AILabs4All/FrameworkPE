The logs show connection attempts, filtering by spam detection systems (e.g., `smtp-amavis`), and rejection of the recipient address. While the attack was blocked (e.g., \"Recipient address rejected\"), the activity constitutes an unconfirmed intrusion attempt (e.g., probing or spam relay abuse). CAT12 (\"Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks\") is appropriate because the incident reflects a failed or mitigated attack, such as network-based probing or exploitation attempts that did not result in confirmed compromise.",

    "response": "Category: CAT10  \nExplanation: The incident involves a machine being used to perform malicious activities (outbound SYN packets to port 3306) after being compromised. The logs indicate the machine is initiating connection attempts to multiple IP addresses on port 3306, which is commonly associated with MySQL services. This aligns with **Misuse of Resources (CAT10)**, as the compromised system is being exploited to launch attacks or reconnaissance (e.g., scanning for vulnerable MySQL instances). While the email mentions an SSH brute force attack as a potential cause (which would fall under CAT1), the observed behavior in the logs reflects unauthorized use of the machine for malicious purposes, making CAT10 the most accurate classification.",

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An IPTV device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.
