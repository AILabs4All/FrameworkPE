Esse\n  serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente\n  para compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n  redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do\n  serviço Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n  ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n  requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n  sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n  de banda maior.

Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com SNMP retorna uma resposta muito maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço SNMP pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de\n  implicar em um consumo de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nSe o SNMP não for utilizado na sua rede desabilite o serviço no seu\n  dispositivo. Se o recurso for utilizado na rede local, configure-o\n  de modo que esteja disponível apenas para a rede local.\n\nEvite utilizar comunidades public e se possível utilize autenticação\n  quando disponível.\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  SNMP para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n    [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um dispositivo vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de dispositivos\n  que usam SNMP que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n  ataques distribuídos de negação de serviços (DDoS).

This suggests a missing configuration issue rather than unauthorized access or disruption.\n\n2. **Identifying NIST Categories:** The categories from CAT4 to CAT12 focus on issues related to data exposure, security breaches, or internal misuse of system resources. The presence of an alert about SNMP usage indicates potential misconfiguration.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Hypothesis:**\n   - **True Hypothesis (CAT4):** The issue likely stems from unauthorized configuration during deployment, which fits with the idea that data leaks could occur due to missing or incorrect configurations.\n   - **False Hypothesis:** If there was no issue with unauthorized access or misconfiguration, it wouldn't fall under CAT4. Instead, other categories like CAT1 (Account Compromise) might apply if credentials were exposed.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The incident is best categorized under CAT4 because it involves the deployment of a configured system that may have been mishandled, leading to potential data leaks or unauthorized access risks.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nTrue Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n\nCategory: CAT4  \nExplanation: The incident likely involves unauthorized configuration of a deployed SNMP service, potentially exposing sensitive credentials or causing a data leak during its deployment.",

The identified version of [ORGANIZATION_9151a836f9] is vulnerable to an account takeover. This allows a malicious party to perform a password reset and have the email delivered to an unverified email address.\n\nScan data\t\nScan time: 2024-01-13T21:41:44.415317894+01:00\nHost: [IP_ADDRESS_41c53d7608]\nPort: 443\nGitlab edition: gitlab-ce\nPossible GitLab version: 16.1.2\n\nIt is possible that GitLab versions have two versions listed, this may be because the hash used is used in two versions. The versions displayed are both vulnerable.\n\nWe have determined that you have a vulnerable version based on the \"hash\" in the manifest.json file. The hash in this file corresponds to certain versions and editions used by GitLab. We also checked whether username and/or email authentication is allowed, as this authentication mechanism is vulnerable to the account takeover vulnerability.\n\nDIVD case file: [URL_e5dc21c9e2]\nGitLab Security Advisory: [URL_f11ed6550e]\n\nIf you have any remaining questions or need help in mitigating this vulnerability, do not hesitate to contact us at [EMAIL_ADDRESS_d0c92c69d6].\n\nDIVD-CSIRT is part of DIVD, a non-profit organization that strives to make the Internet safer. More information about this institute can be found at [URL_26e99c0a46].\n\nThank you for your time and attention.\n\nDIVD-CSIRT\n\nP.S.

Esse\n  serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente\n  para compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n  redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do\n  serviço Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n  ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n  requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n  sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n  de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n  informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n  aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n  seja acessível apenas via TCP. Caso o serviço Portmap seja\n  desnecessário nesse servidor, recomendamos que ele seja desativado.\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  Portmap para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n    [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n- Openly accessible Portmapper services\n    [URL_5f26128084]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um servidor Portmap vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de servidores\n  Portmap que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n  ataques distribuído]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n        \"\n\n            Instructions:\n            For NIST category Considered tha Category: CAT3 and keyword: ddos, dos, denial of service, flood, syn flood, udp flood, botnet, api outage, site down perform the following steps:\n\n            1.

The identified version of [ORGANIZATION_9151a836f9] is vulnerable to an account takeover. This allows a malicious party to perform a password reset and have the email delivered to an unverified email address.\n\nScan data\t\nScan time: 2024-01-13T21:41:44.415317894+01:00\nHost: [IP_ADDRESS_41c53d7608]\nPort: 443\nGitlab edition: gitlab-ce\nPossible GitLab version: 16.1.2\n\nIt is possible that GitLab versions have two versions listed, this may be because the hash used is used in two versions. The versions displayed are both vulnerable.\n\nWe have determined that you have a vulnerable version based on the \"hash\" in the manifest.json file. The hash in this file corresponds to certain versions and editions used by GitLab. We also checked whether username and/or email authentication is allowed, as this authentication mechanism is vulnerable to the account takeover vulnerability.\n\nDIVD case file: [URL_e5dc21c9e2]\nGitLab Security Advisory: [URL_f11ed6550e]\n\nIf you have any remaining questions or need help in mitigating this vulnerability, do not hesitate to contact us at [EMAIL_ADDRESS_d0c92c69d6].\n\nDIVD-CSIRT is part of DIVD, a non-profit organization that strives to make the Internet safer.

Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nPossuir um roteador com serviço BGP acessível para qualquer IP via\n   Internet aumenta os riscos de uma negação de serviço contra o\n   serviço BGP de sua rede.  Idealmente o serviço BGP de um roteador\n   deveria estar acessível apenas para os roteadores que necessitem\n   estabelecer uma sessão BGP com este equipamento.\n\n2. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nRecomenda-se que sejam implementadas ACLs para que o serviço BGP\n   seja acessível somente aos roteadores que necessitem estabelecer\n   uma sessão BGP com este equipamento.\n\nEstas ACLs devem ser configuradas conforme descrito na seção\n   \"Protection of the BGP Speaker\" do documento:\n\n- RFC 7454: BGP Operations and Security\n     [URL_135fcdbf96]\n\n- No caso de equipamentos Juniper, consulte:\n     TCP Access Restriction for BGP\n     [URL_cc7733d47b]\n\n- No caso de equipamentos Cisco, consulte:\n     Protecting Border Gateway Protocol for the Enterprise, Section Infrastructure ACLs\n     [URL_06dd6bd3f2]\n\n3.

Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior.

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.\n\nThis i]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n        \"\n\n            Instructions:\n            For NIST category Considered tha Category: CAT1 and keyword: phishing, brute force, unauthorized access, compromised password, credential theft, account compromise, token, oauth, ssh, suspicious login perform the following steps:\n\n            1.

Thus, the True Hypothesis supports the classification under CAT3.\n\n**Final Classification Decision**:\n- Category: Cat3\n- Explanation: The incident could lead to DDoS attacks if misconfigured servers are used for attack vectors such as negation or other malicious purposes, aligning with the NIST categories identified.",

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An IPTV device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.\n\nThis is]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n        \"\n\n            Instructions:\n            For NIST category Considered tha Category: CAT1 and keyword: phishing, brute force, unauthorized access, compromised password, credential theft, account compromise, token, oauth, ssh, suspicious login perform the following steps:\n\n            1.

It focuses on exploiting a known vulnerability within software execution techniques rather than unauthorized access to accounts or systems.",
