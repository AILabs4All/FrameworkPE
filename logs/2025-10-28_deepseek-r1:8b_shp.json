    "response": "### Response\n\n**Incident Classification:**\n\n- **Category Code:** CAT12\n- **Justification:** The incident involves multiple failed SSH login attempts from a single IP address, which is characteristic of a brute force attack. This is an unconfirmed attempt to gain unauthorized access, as no successful compromise is indicated in the logs. CAT12 specifically covers \"unconfirmed attacks,\" including methods like brute force, network scans, and blocked exploits, which aligns with this incident being a probe for potential intrusion without confirmed success. This categorization is appropriate because the focus is on the attempt itself, rather than a confirmed compromise or other types of attacks like malware or data leaks.",

This aligns with the NIST definition of Denial of Service attacks, which include volumetric DDoS attacks like the one described, where multiple compromised hosts (including the one in question) are used to flood networks or systems, making them unavailable. The description explicitly references a \"coordinated DDoS botnet\" with a size of Nx10Gbps, which is a clear example of a Denial of Service attack. While the incident also involves the compromise of a host (potentially due to vulnerabilities), the core event being reported is the attack itself, not the method of compromise, making CAT3 the most appropriate category.",

    "response": "### Classification:\n- **Category Code:** CAT7\n- **Explanation:** The incident involves an email server sending fraudulent emails that attempt to extort users, which is a form of social engineering. Social engineering relies on deception to manipulate individuals into providing information or acting in a way that benefits the attacker. In this case, the fraudulent emails are designed to deceive users into complying with extortion demands, aligning with the definition of social engineering (e.g., phishing or similar deceptive tactics). This categorization is based on the deceptive nature of the attack, as specified in the NIST CAT7 description.\n\n### Justification:\n- The incident description explicitly mentions fraudulent emails being sent for extortion, which falls under deceptive practices aimed at gaining control or compliance from users. This is a classic example of social engineering, as it uses psychological manipulation rather than technical exploits or malware. While other categories like CAT10 (Misuse of Resources) could be considered (e.g., unauthorized use of the server for extortion), CAT7 is more precise because it directly addresses the deceptive aspect, which is the core issue here. The NIST CAT7 examples include phishing, which is a subset of social engineering, making this the most appropriate classification.",

Social engineering relies on deception to manipulate individuals into providing information or acting in a way that benefits the attacker. In this case, the fraudulent emails are designed to deceive users into complying with extortion demands, aligning with the definition of social engineering (e.g., phishing or similar deceptive tactics). This categorization is based on the deceptive nature of the attack, as specified in the NIST CAT7 description.\n\n### Justification:\n- The incident description explicitly mentions fraudulent emails being sent for extortion, which falls under deceptive practices aimed at gaining control or compliance from users. This is a classic example of social engineering, as it uses psychological manipulation rather than technical exploits or malware. While other categories like CAT10 (Misuse of Resources) could be considered (e.g., unauthorized use of the server for extortion), CAT7 is more precise because it directly addresses the deceptive aspect, which is the core issue here. The NIST CAT7 examples include phishing, which is a subset of social engineering, making this the most appropriate classification. The category is: CAT10 \n        If classification is not possible, return:\n        Category: Unknown\n        Explanation: Unknown\n        \n        OUTPUT:\n        Category: [NIST code]\n        Explanation: [Justification for the chosen category]\n        ",
