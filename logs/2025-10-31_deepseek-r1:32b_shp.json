We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An IPTV device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

    "response": "**Classification:**\n\n- **Category:** CAT3 - Denial of Service Attack\n- **Explanation:** The incident involves misconfigured NTP servers that could be exploited to launch DDoS attacks, specifically through amplification. This fits CAT3 as it pertains to the potential disruption of services via such attacks.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Incident:** The alert from CERT.br highlights that certain NTP servers are improperly configured, allowing them to be used in DDoS attacks. Commands like monlist and readvar can enable attackers to send amplified responses, overwhelming target systems.\n\n2. **Analyzing NIST Categories:** Each category was reviewed to determine the best fit. CAT3 (Denial of Service Attack) was identified as the most appropriate because it directly addresses the potential for service disruption through DDoS activities.\n\n3. **Ruling Out Other Categories:** Other categories like CAT5 (Vulnerability Exploitation) were considered but didn't align as closely with the incident's focus on service disruption rather than direct system exploitation.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The primary concern is the risk of these servers being used to cause denial of service, making CAT3 the most suitable classification.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe incident is classified under **CAT3 - Denial of Service Attack** because it involves potential misuse of NTP servers to facilitate DDoS attacks, leading to service unavailability.",

    "response": "**Categorization:**\n\n- **Category:** CAT10 - Misuse of Resources\n- **Explanation:** The incident involves an email server being used to send fraudulent extortion attempts.
