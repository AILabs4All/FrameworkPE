O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3.
