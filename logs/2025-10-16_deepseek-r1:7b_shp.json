    "response": "**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\nThe incident described involves multiple SSH connection attempts without proper authentication from different remote IPs. These attempts are unlikely to result in unauthorized access but rather suggest potential brute force or password guesses for SSH authentication.\n\nBased on NIST categories:\n\n1. **No direct evidence of unauthorized access, data leakage, or system compromise is present in the logs.**\n2. The incident appears to be about attempted unauthorized access rather than an actual breach.\n3. The use of SSH with weak credentials hints at a potential vulnerability exploitation.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nCategory: CAT5  \nExplanation: The incident involves multiple SSH connection attempts without proper authentication, which could indicate exploit of known SSH vulnerabilities (e.g., weak passwords or keys). This falls under Vulnerability Exploitation (CAT5) as it relates to unauthorized access through technical flaws.",

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP. Caso o serviço Portmap seja\n   desnecessário nesse servidor, recomendamos que ele seja desativado.\n\n4. Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n   Portmap para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n     [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n- Openly accessible Portmapper services\n     [URL_5f26128084]\n\n5.

Por se tratar de um serviço utilizado apenas dentro \n  de redes locais, não é necessário que o serviço mDNS esteja exposto \n  à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n  ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com mDNS retorna uma resposta muito maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço mDNS pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de\n  implicar em um consumo de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nSe o serviço mDNS não for utilizado na sua rede desabilite o serviço no\n  seu dispositivo.
