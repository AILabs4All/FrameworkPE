This fits into the category of Intrusion Attempt (CAT12) as it represents unconfirmed attacks such as brute force attempts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Nature of the Incident:** The logs show repeated failed SSH authentication attempts with various usernames and incorrect passwords from a single IP address.\n2. **Match to NIST Categories:** These activities are characteristic of an intrusion attempt, specifically a brute force attack, which is classified under CAT12.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since there's no evidence of successful access or exploitation, it remains an attempted intrusion.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nCategory: CAT12  \nExplanation: The incident involves multiple failed SSH login attempts from an external IP address, indicating an unauthorized attempt to gain access without success.

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

Essas\nações possibilitam, por exemplo, o abuso dessas contas para campanhas de\nphishing e furto de informações sensíveis.\n\nGostaríamos de solicitar que:\n\n* Por favor verifique se o servidor Zimbra está realmente vulnerável.\n    Não realizamos testes para avaliar a veracidade dessas informações;\n\n* Em caso afirmativo, atualize o software com os patches\n    mais recentes disponíveis de acordo com as instruções do\n    desenvolvedor;\n\n* Verifique se o sistema foi comprometido.\n\nSe você não for a pessoa correta para corrigir o problema destes\nservidores, por favor repasse essa mensagem para alguém de sua\norganização que possa fazê-lo.\n\nSe você for contato de mais de uma rede ou domínio é possível que você\nreceba mais de um email desse tipo, com conteúdos diferentes.  Por favor\nnão apague outras notificações que vier a receber.\n\nCaso os respectivos patches já tenham sido aplicados, pedimos que por\nfavor desconsidere essa mensagem.\n\n=======================================================================================================\nIP              | Porta | Timestamp (UTC)      | Dominio                        | CVE\n[IP_ADDRESS_03a87af528]    | 80    | 2023-04-22T12:28:34Z | mail.softwarelivre.org         | cve-2022-37042;zimbra\n[IP_ADDRESS_03a87af528]    | 8080  | 2023-04-23T03:07:37Z | mail.softwarelivre.org         | cve-2022-37042;zimbra\n[IP_ADDRESS_03a87af528]    | 443   | 2023-04-23T04:09:20Z | mail.softwarelivre.org         | cve-2022-37042;zimbra\n=======================================================================================================\n\nMais detalhes sobre o motivo do envio desta mensagem, quem é o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] e\ncomo resolver este problema estão listados abaixo.\n\nCordialmente,\n--\nCERT.br/NIC.br\n<[EMAIL_ADDRESS_83824c64b2]>\n[URL_ea4f5d47bf]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este endereço IP possui um serviço vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] recebe de parceiros listas contendo informações sobre os\n  IPs com serviços vulneráveis.\n\n* Como resolver o problema?\n\nRecomendamos que siga as instruções de atualização publicadas pelo\n  desenvolvedor nos URLs abaixo:\n\n[URL_e147fd18f2]\n  [URL_3cf7704766]\n\n* Como faço para determinar se meu servidor foi comprometido?\n\nRecomendamos que verifique o sistema e seus logs em busca de processos\n  e arquivos desconhecidos, autenticações e tráfego de rede incomuns.\n\nAlguns IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) tem sido publicados sobre esse\n  problema.
