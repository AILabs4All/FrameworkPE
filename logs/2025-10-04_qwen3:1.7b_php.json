Esse protocolo pode\n  ser utilizado por sistemas operacionais e por dispositivos de rede,\n  por exemplo, para obter arquivos de atualização de software ou de\n  configuração.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n  ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com TFTP retorna uma resposta maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço TFTP pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de implicar\n  em um consumo de banda maior.

The malicious use of NTP services for DDoS attacks directly targets the denial-of-service objective. While **CAT10** (misuse of resources) could apply if the servers are being used for unauthorized activities, the core issue here is the **attack itself** (DDoS via NTP misconfiguration), making **CAT3** the most precise classification.",

Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com ARMS retorna uma resposta maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO ARMS pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo sua\n  rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de implicar em um consumo\n  de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nRecomendamos que desabilite o serviço ARD caso ele nao seja utilizado.\n  Dessa forma o serviço ARMS tambem será desativado.\n\nCaso o serviço seja necessário a você ou sua organização, pedimos \n  que execute os procedimentos descritos na URL abaixo para permitir\n  o acesso a esses serviços apenas para os endereços IP autorizados.\n\n- ARD/ARMS abuse and securing MacOSX devices against DDoS Amplification attacks\n  [URL_4b1152b059]\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  ARMS para ataques DDoS?\n\n- A Call to ARMS: Apple Remote Management Service UDP Reflection/Amplification DDoS Attacks\n  [URL_93408e8865]\n\n- ARD/ARMS abuse and securing MacOSX devices against DDoS Amplification attacks\n  [URL_4b1152b059]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um servidor ARMS vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de servidores AR]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n         \n        If classification is not possible, return:\n        Category: Unknown\n        Explanation: Unknown\n        \n        OUTPUT:\n        Category: [NIST code]\n        Explanation: [Justification for the chosen category]\n        ",
    "response": "\n\nCategory: CAT3  \nExplanation: The incident involves the activation of the ARMS service on a device, which is a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack vector. The service's open state allows attackers to exploit UDP reflection for amplification, making systems unavailable. This aligns with CAT3, which covers attacks that disrupt system accessibility, such as DDoS floods or unauthenticated access attempts. The configuration vulnerability (service enabled) directly contributes to the risk of unavailability, fulfilling the criteria for a Denial of Service Attack.",

Esse\n  serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente\n  para compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n  redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do\n  serviço Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n  ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n  requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n  sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n  de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n  informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n  aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n  seja acessível apenas via TCP.

Esse\n  serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente\n  para compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n  redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do\n  serviço Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n  ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n  requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n  sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n  de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n  informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n  aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n  seja acessível apenas via TCP. Caso o serviço Portmap seja\n  desnecessário nesse servidor, recomendamos que ele seja desativado.\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  Portmap para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n    [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n- Openly accessible Portmapper services\n    [URL_5f26128084]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um servidor Portmap vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de servidores\n  Portmap que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n  ataques distribuído]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n         \n        If classification is not possible, return:\n        Category: Unknown\n        Explanation: Unknown\n        \n        OUTPUT:\n        Category: [NIST code]\n        Explanation: [Justification for the chosen category]\n        ",

Esse\n  serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente\n  para compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n  redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do\n  serviço Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n  ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação.

The logs show multiple failed login attempts by an IP address ( [IP_ADDRESS_b29a075d57] ) with invalid usernames (e.g., \"dani,\" \"tracy,\" \"wrc,\" etc.) and passwords. This aligns with **Account Compromise** (CAT1), as the malicious activity targets unauthorized access to user accounts, specifically through credential theft (e.g., brute force attacks). The email from CERT.br is a response to the incident, but the core issue is the unauthorized technical access attempts recorded in the system logs. No malware, DDoS, or insider abuse is indicated.",
