It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems.

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP. Caso o serviço Portmap seja\n   desnecessário nesse servidor, recomendamos que ele seja desativado.\n\n4.

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP. Caso o serviço Portmap seja\n   desnecessário nesse servidor, recomendamos que ele seja desativado.\n\n4.
