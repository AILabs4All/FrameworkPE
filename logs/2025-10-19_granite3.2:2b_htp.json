We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_2002177763])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

    "response": "True Hypothesis:\n- Supported\n   - Justification: The incident involves a compromised IP address that was used to launch an attack (DDoS) on another network. This is consistent with phishing, brute force attempts, unauthorized access, credential theft, and account compromise. Keywords like \"compromised host,\" \"attack,\" \"limited number of distinct hosts attacking us,\" and \"non-random distribution of IP addresses\" support this classification.\n\nFalse Hypothesis:\n- Not Supported\n   - Justification: There is no explicit mention in the incident description that a phishing attack or unauthorized login attempts occurred. Instead, it discusses a compromised network device potentially being part of a DDoS botnet, suggesting that access was gained through other means such as vulnerable configurations (e.g., default usernames and passwords) on routers or compromised software (like vulnerable Drupal versions).\n\nFinal Classification Decision:\n- Category: CAT1\n- Explanation: The incident description strongly aligns with the NIST category for Account Compromise, marked as CAT1. This is due to evidence of unauthorized access through a network device likely compromised by malicious actors or misconfigured software, leading to potential usage in a DDoS attack. The keywords and context of limited IP addresses matching past attacks, similar devices possibly affected, and no indication of phishing attempts support this classification.",

    "response": "True Hypothesis:[SUPPORTED]\n\nExplanation: The incident description suggests potential account compromise (CAT1) due to phishing-like behavior and unauthorized access attempts through suspicious login activities. Key phrases like \"responsável\" (responsible), \"alerta\" (alert), and the mention of \"credenciais\" (credentials or login information) indicate that this might be a case where attackers are attempting to gain unauthorized access via compromised credentials, possibly through phishing emails mimicking legitimate communication. Although not explicitly stated as credential theft or brute force attacks, these tactics are often precursors to such actions, and the incident mentions \"status/pacotes/bytes\" which could imply testing for specific response sizes indicative of amplification, a common technique used in DDoS attacks (which may indirectly suggest potential credential theft or exploitation).\n\nFalse Hypothesis:[NOT SUPPORTED]\n\nExplanation: The incident description does not explicitly indicate that this is a social engineering attack such as phishing. While there are mentions of emails and responsibilities, no clear signs point towards deception for unauthorized login attempts. The focus of the alert is on NTP server misconfiguration leading to potential DDoS vulnerabilities rather than convincing fraudulent communications designed solely to trick users into disclosing credentials.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:\n\nCategory: CAT1\nExplanation: This incident description leans heavily towards Account Compromise (CAT1). The primary theme revolves around unauthorized attempts at accessing user accounts possibly due to compromised or stolen credentials, which aligns with phishing-like activities and credential theft. Although not overtly mentioned as such, indicators within the text suggest that attackers may be attempting exploitation of legitimate login processes for their malicious purposes. The incident's emphasis on NTP server misconfigurations that could facilitate amplification attacks makes this a plausible CAT1 classification.",

    "response": "True Hypothesis:[SUPPORTED]\nExplanation: The incident description appears to be a promotional email containing a scheduled event for CERT.br courses, specifically focusing on 'Fundamentals of Incident Handling (FIH)'.

The primary focus is on suspected SSH login attempts from a single IP address, which points towards account compromise rather than these other possibilities.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:\n- Category: CAT1\n- Explanation: The incident description indicates repeated failed SSH authentication attempts (and subsequent disconnects) from one source IP, implying unauthorized access and potential credential theft or brute force attack.

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação.

This includes phishing-like behavior since attackers might send forged requests to exploit this open service, potentially mimicking legitimate user actions.\n\nFalse Hypothesis:[NOT SUPPORTED]\nExplanation: The incident does not describe direct instances of phishing emails or unauthorized login attempts. Instead, it focuses on monitoring an exposed Portmap service and alerting administrators about the potential risk of misuse for Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and information disclosure due to its inherent nature as a mapping service. Hence, this hypothesis is not supported based on the given description.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:\nCategory: CAT1\nExplanation: The incident falls under Account Compromise - unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts (CAT1). This is because the presence of an open Portmap service potentially implies vulnerabilities in network security measures, allowing external entities to attempt legitimate actions using compromised credentials. By alerting administrators about a misconfigured service, it acts as precaution against account takeovers and credential-based attacks.",

    "response": "True Hypothesis:\n- SUPPORTED\n- Justification: The incident description indicates that logs show suspicious activities on a network machine, potentially compromised by an attacker who is using it for malicious purposes or a legitimate user might be involved in unauthorized actions contrary to the accepted usage policy. Keywords such as \"malicious activities,\" \"compromising this machine,\" and \"based attacks\" support CAT1 (Account Compromise) category, where examples include credential phishing, SSH brute force, and OAuth token theft, which align with the scenario described in the incident.\n\nFalse Hypothesis:\n- NOT SUPPORTED\n- Justification: The description does not explicitly mention account compromise due to traditional phishing attacks or unauthorized access via stolen credentials (phishing emails). Instead, it describes suspicious SSH activities, implying potential brute force attacks against the SSH service. However, this does not conclusively rule out phishing as an origin for unauthorized access, but the text doesn't confirm it either, supporting CAT1 as a reasonable possibility given the evidence presented.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:\n- Category: CAT1\n- Explanation: The incident description aligns closely with Account Compromise (CAT1) due to the suspicious SSH activities which suggest an attempt at unauthorized access via brute force on protected services (SSH). This behavior is often indicative of attempts for credential theft or compromise through phishing attacks. Although the text does not explicitly mention phishing, other methods of account compromise are more plausible given these suspicious activities around SSH logins. Hence, CAT1 remains the most suitable category based on the provided evidence.",

    "response": "True Hypothesis:\n- SUPPORTED\n- Justification: The incident involves unauthorized access and potential compromise of SNMP services on devices associated with an organization (ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4). This aligns with CAT1 - Account Compromise, as the issue could stem from credential theft or phishing attempts that led to unauthorized SNMP service usage. The description also mentions the possibility of volumetric DoS attacks via SNMP protocol, which falls under CAT3 - Denial of Service Attack.\n\nFalse Hypothesis:\n- NOT SUPPORTED\n- Justification: There's no evidence in the provided description suggesting this is a phishing attempt or an SSH brute force attack (CAT2) targeting individual accounts. Instead, it appears to be a broader network security issue involving multiple devices with SNMP services potentially misused for DDoS attacks (CAT3).\n\nFinal Classification Decision:\n- Category: CAT1\n- Explanation: The incident is primarily accounted for by Category 1 - Account Compromise. This is because it pertains to unauthorized access and potential abuse of the SNMP service on devices, possibly through credential compromise or phishing techniques (similar keywords like 'credentials' are present in both hypotheses). Although some aspects could also implicate a denial-of-service attack (CAT3), the core issue seems more focused on account manipulation.",
