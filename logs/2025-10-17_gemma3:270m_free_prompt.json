We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_2002177763])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

    "response": "Okay, I've analyzed the security incident and categorized it according to NIST guidelines.\n\n**Cat1: Account Compromise**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts. This constitutes a breach of account security, as it allows unauthorized individuals to access and modify sensitive data.\n\n**Cat2: Malware**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Infection by malicious code. This is a common attack vector for malware, as it can be used to compromise systems and disrupt operations.\n\n**Cat3: Denial of Service Attack**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Making systems unavailable. This attack is a form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack, where a malicious actor floods a system with requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users.\n\n**Cat4: Data Leak**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. This is a form of data leakage, as it allows unauthorized parties to access and modify data without proper authorization.\n\n**Cat5: Vulnerability Exploitation**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Using technical flaws for attacks. This is a common technique used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in systems and applications.\n\n**Cat6: Insider Abuse**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Malicious actions by internal users. This attack is a form of insider abuse, as it allows malicious users to access and manipulate systems and data.\n\n**Cat7: Social Engineering**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Deception to gain access or data. This attack is a form of social engineering, as it involves manipulating individuals to gain access to sensitive information or data.\n\n**Cat8: Physical Incident**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Impact due to unauthorized physical access. This is a form of physical incident, as it occurs when a physical access is triggered by unauthorized physical access to a system or data.\n\n*   **Classification:** Physical Incident.\n\n**Cat9: Unauthorized Modification**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Improper changes to systems or data. This is a form of unauthorized modification, as it occurs when unauthorized individuals modify systems or data without authorization.\n\n**Cat10: Misuse of Resources**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Unauthorized use for other purposes. This is a form of misuse, as it occurs when unauthorized individuals use resources (e.g., computational power, database access) for other malicious purposes.\n\n**Cat11: Third-Party Issues**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Security failures by suppliers. This is a form of third-party issues, as it occurs when a security provider fails to adequately protect a system or data.\n\n**Cat12: Intrusion Attempt**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Unconfirmed attacks. This is an attack that was not confirmed by the security vendor. It is a form of intrusion attempt, as it involves unauthorized access to a system or data.\n\n**CLASSIFICATION EXAMPLES**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Incident:** \"Multiple failed SSH login attempts detected from external IP 192.168.1.100\"\n    *   **Category:** CAT12\n    *   **Explanation:** Network scanning and brute force attempts represent intrusion attempts that were blocked/detected but not successful.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Incident:** \"Ransomware detected on workstation, files encrypted with .crypto extension\"\n    *   **Category:** CAT2\n    *   **Explanation:** Clear malware infection with ransomware, representing malicious code that has successfully infected the system.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Incident:** \"Employee accessed and downloaded customer database without authorization\"\n    *   **Category:** CAT6\n    *   **Explanation:** Internal user performing unauthorized actions, representing insider abuse of access privileges.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   **Incident:** \"Employee accessed and downloaded customer database without authorization\"\n    *   **Category:** CAT6\n    *   **Explanation:** Internal user performing unauthorized actions, representing insider abuse of access privileges.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Context is Key:** The categorization of incidents should be based on the specific context of the incident. For example, if an incident involves a suspected breach of data confidentiality, it should be classified as \"Data De-Message.\"\n*   **Severity:** The severity of the incident can impact the classification. A minor issue might be classified as \"cat12\" under the CAT12 category, while a more serious issue might be classified as \"cat13\" under the CAT13 category.\n*   **Ongoing Monitoring:** Security incidents should be monitored regularly to detect and respond to potential threats.\n\nI hope this detailed analysis is helpful!
