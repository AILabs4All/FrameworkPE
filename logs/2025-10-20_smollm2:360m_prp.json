We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_2002177763])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems.

    "response": "Based on the description provided in the email, it appears that the incident was a DDoS attack targeting an internal network. The attackers compromised one of the victim's hosts using malware and brute-forced their way into the system through SSH or RDP. They then used this compromised host to send numerous DDoS requests to the victim's IP address, which is under the attacker's control.\n\nThe attackers likely exploited a vulnerability in a network adapter driver to infect the host with malware, allowing them to perform this attack. The use of an external link for amplification and the flooding of traffic from 30 seconds were indicative of a DoS technique as well as a potential exploit used against vulnerable systems.\n\nThe attackers may have also used an RCE or SQL injection vulnerability in one of the web applications they had access to to further compromise the victim's system. The use of compromised credentials, data leak, and social engineering tactics could indicate that the attackers were using the victim's internal network for other purposes as well.\n\nBased on this information, the best classification would be:\n\nCat1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n\nThis is justified because it appears that the incident was a DDoS attack targeting an internal system where credentials were compromised and used for further malicious activities. The attackers likely exploited a vulnerability in network adapters or other systems to gain control of the host, which allowed them to perform attacks on other systems as well.",

    "response": "Here's a more detailed response for your question:\n\n1. I would classify this incident as an \"Account Compromise\" due to its focus on unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts, such as credential phishing attacks. The problem involves making systems unavailable, which is consistent with the category of \"Malware.\"\n\n2. For example, if you have been targeted by a ransomware attack where your account was compromised and your password has been stolen, this would be classified as an Account Compromise incident.\n\n3. The other categories listed such as Denial of Service (DoS) or Malware are more focused on specific types of attacks that can harm systems or data in the physical world. For instance, if you were targeted by a malware attack at your home network that affected your computer and files, this would be classified as a Physical Incident rather than an Account Compromise incident.\n\n4. The other categories for which no classification was given are \"Insider Abuse\" (Snooping or sabotage), \"Misuse of Resources,\" and \"Third-Party Issues.\" These categories do not seem to fit the specific description of this incident, as it involves unauthorized access to user accounts rather than misuse of resources, third-party exploitation, or physical attacks.\n\n5. If a more detailed explanation is needed for the chosen category, I would suggest that you provide more context about the specific event and its severity level. This could help narrow down the possible classifications.",

This means it may be vulnerable to DDoS attacks. This issue can have serious consequences, as it allows attackers to send large amounts of traffic in short periods of time, overwhelming a network or system.\n        When this happens, the server becomes less responsive to requests from other users on the same network, which can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Furthermore, if the portmap port is used by third parties such as data centers or cloud providers for communication, it can result in significant disruptions. As a result, we need to take steps to protect against these issues and prevent them from occurring in the first place.",
