Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com SNMP retorna uma resposta muito maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço SNMP pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de\n  implicar em um consumo de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nSe o SNMP não for utilizado na sua rede desabilite o serviço no seu\n  dispositivo. Se o recurso for utilizado na rede local, configure-o\n  de modo que esteja disponível apenas para a rede local.\n\nEvite utilizar comunidades public e se possível utilize autenticação\n  quando disponível.\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  SNMP para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n    [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um dispositivo vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de dispositivos\n  que usam SNMP que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n  ataques distribuídos de negação de serviços (DDoS).

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP.

    "response": "True Hypothesis: [SUPPORTED]\nThe incident description details that the service SNMP, when accessible via UDP, can be exploited for attacks like DDoS using amplification. This leverages \"malicious code\" – specifically, the amplification attack itself – to overwhelm systems. The mention of \"amplification attacks\" and the potential for a DDoS attack strongly suggests malware or malicious code is involved.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: [NOT SUPPORTED]\nThe description doesn't explicitly state the presence of malware, ransomware, or a virus. It focuses on the vulnerability of the SNMP service being exploited for DDoS attacks.  While exploitation *could* involve malicious code, the primary issue described is the vulnerability itself and its exploitation, not the specific type of malware.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:\nCategory: CAT3\nExplanation: The incident aligns with Category CAT3 – Denial of Service Attack – due to the exploitation of the SNMP service for amplification attacks, which constitutes a DDoS attack. The core issue is the disruption of network services caused by the attack, consistent with the definition of a Denial of Service attack.\n",
