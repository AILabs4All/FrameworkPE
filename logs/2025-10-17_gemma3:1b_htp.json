We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_2002177763])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

    "response": "True Hypothesis:\n- The incident involves a compromised host used for an attack, which strongly suggests a phishing attack. The message itself is a clear attempt to warn about a compromised host, indicating malicious intent.\n- The attacker is targeting customers with a compromised host, a common tactic used in phishing campaigns.\n- The attacker is using a botnet, suggesting a coordinated attack and potentially a significant volume of traffic.\n- The description references a \"coordinated DDoS botnet\" and the attacker is exploiting this for significant packet loss, indicating a potential for network saturation.\n- The attacker is using a variety of IP addresses, some of which are already in the past, which suggests a targeted attack against a specific user.\n- The use of a compromised host with a WAN access enabled is a common indicator of a malicious setup.\n\nFalse Hypothesis:\n- The description doesn’t suggest unauthorized access to user accounts. The mention of a compromised host is a result of an attack, not an unauthorized access.\n- The description doesn't indicate the attacker is trying to steal credentials or data. It focuses on the exploitation of a compromised host for an attack.\n- The description doesn’t involve any potential for denial of service. The attacker is attacking customers, not making systems unavailable.\n- The description doesn't mention any vulnerability exploitation. It's a data leak incident.\n- The description doesn’t describe the attacker’s activity beyond the initial attack, which is a typical scenario for a DDoS attack.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:\nCategory: CAT1\nExplanation: The incident description clearly falls under the category of phishing, brute force, unauthorized access, and compromised host, aligning with the elements of a phishing campaign and a potential botnet attack.\n",

The details of the misconfigured servers, the potential for abuse, and the involvement of CERT.br point to this.\n\n**False Hypothesis:** The incident *does not* strongly suggest a phishing attack. The description focuses on configuration errors rather than malicious intent. The mention of \"monlist\" and \"readvar\" are technical details related to security testing and not indicative of a coordinated attack.\n\n**Final Classification Decision:**\n\n**Category:** CAT1\n**Explanation:** The incident description strongly indicates a potential phishing attack, specifically targeting NTP servers. The key elements – misconfigured servers, potential for abuse, and the involvement of CERT.br – all align with the characteristics of a phishing attempt. The use of \"monlist\" and \"readvar\" are indicators that the attacker is attempting to probe for vulnerabilities and gain information.

    "response": "True Hypothesis:\n- The incident involves a malicious email (attachment) containing a link to a website where the user is prompted to enter their credentials. This is a classic phishing attack, which is a common tactic used to obtain credentials for account compromise. The email itself contains the crucial information about the target IP address, which is a key indicator of a brute-force attack.\n- The user is directly communicating with the attacker through email, which is the typical method for phishing.\n- The attacker is attempting to gain unauthorized access to the user’s account using a common tactic – password theft.\n- The attacker's activity is directly linked to an attempt to access the user's account through the email.\n\nFalse Hypothesis:\n- The incident does not involve any direct attempt to steal credentials or gain unauthorized access. It’s a simple email exchange about a whois lookup and a potential denial of service attack.\n- The incident is not about malicious content, but rather a routine administrative task and a straightforward query about IP address. The `whois` lookup is a normal procedure, and the email is just a confirmation of the information.\n- There are no indications of unauthorized modification or misuse of resources.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:\nCategory: CAT1\nExplanation: The incident clearly demonstrates a phishing attack, specifically a brute-force attack targeting the user's credentials. The email itself is a direct invitation to provide login details, which is the core of a phishing attempt. The investigation into the IP address is a result of this attempt.",

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP. Caso o serviço Portmap seja\n   desnecessário nesse servidor, recomendamos que ele seja desativado.\n\n4. Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n   Portmap para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n     [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n- Openly accessible Portmapper services\n     [URL_5f26128084]\n\n5. Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um servidor Portmap vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de servidores\n   Portmap que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n   ataques distribuídos de negação de serviços (DDoS).

Este serviço\npode ser abusado para fazer parte de ataques distribuídos de negação\nde serviço, consumindo recursos da sua rede e impactando terceiros.\n\nLembramos que os endereços IP listados, além de servidores e\ncomputadores, também podem ser de dispositivos de rede com o serviço\nSNMP habilitado, como roteadores, impressoras, CPEs (modem ou roteador\nde uso doméstico instalado nos clientes), entre outros.\n\nGostaríamos de solicitar que:\n\n* o servico SNMP seja configurado corretamente ou desabilitado no\n   equipamento, caso não esteja em uso.\n\nUma descrição do problema e possíveis soluções podem ser encontradas\nno final deste documento.\n\nSe você não for a pessoa correta para corrigir o problema destes\nequipamentos com o serviço SNMP habilitado, por favor repasse essa\nmensagem para alguém de sua organização que possa fazê-lo.\n\nO indicador no campo 'Resultados do Teste' indica o tipo de problema\ntestado e significa:\n\n* snmp: status/pacotes/bytes, onde status é \"open\", e pacotes/bytes\n   indicam o tamanho da resposta recebida, em pacotes/bytes.\n\n====================================================================================\nEndereco IP      | ASN    | Status | Data do Teste        | Resultados do Teste\n[IP_ADDRESS_c8174cb77f]    | 2716   | OPEN   | 2022-05-09T11:16:07Z | snmp: open/1/211\n[IP_ADDRESS_514c3637fc]   | 2716   | OPEN   | 2022-05-09T11:16:07Z | snmp: open/1/140\n[IP_ADDRESS_7d3c82ab0a]     | 2716   | OPEN   | 2022-05-09T11:16:14Z | snmp: open/1/215\n====================================================================================\nMais detalhes sobre o porque do envio desta mensagem, quem é o\nCERT.br e como resolver este problema estão listados abaixo.\n\nCordialmente,\n-- \nCERT.br\n<[EMAIL_ADDRESS_83824c64b2]>\n[URL_ea4f5d47bf]\n\n* O que é o serviço SNMP (161/udp)?\n\nO SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) é um protocolo de rede\n  utilizado para gerenciamento e diagnóstico de dispositivos de redes.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n  ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com SNMP retorna uma resposta muito maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço SNMP pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de\n  implicar em um consumo de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nSe o SNMP não for utilizado na sua rede desabilite o serviço no seu\n  dispositivo. Se o recurso for utilizado na rede local, configure-o\n  de modo que esteja disponível apenas para a rede local.\n\nEvite utilizar comunidades public e se possível utilize autenticação\n  quando disponível.\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  SNMP para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n    [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um dispositivo vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de dispositivos\n  que usam SNMP que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n  ataques distribuídos de negação de serviços (DDoS).  O [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está\n  notificando os responsáveis pelos dispositivos brasileiros presentes\n  nestas listas.\n\n* Como posso ter certeza que resolvi o problema?\n\nVocê pode verificar seu dispositivo atravás dos seguintes comandos:\n  (preferencialmente execute-os a partir da Internet, ou seja, fora de\n  uma rede interna que tenha permissão de acesso ao dispositivo).\n\n$ snmpget -v 2c]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n        \"\n\n            Instructions:\n            For NIST category Considered tha Category: CAT2 and keyword: malware, ransomware, trojan, virus, spyware, rootkit, infection, malicious code perform the following steps:\n\n            1.

    "response": "Here's the classification and justification for the incident description, following the instructions:\n\n**True Hypothesis:**\n- Assume the incident belongs to this category. Justify based on the description and keywords.\n- The description explicitly states the incident is related to SNMP, which is a known component of malware and ransomware, particularly those targeting network devices. The mention of \"ransomware\" and \"malicious code\" strongly suggests this category.\n- The use of \"malicious code\" and \"compromising the network\" points to a potential attack.\n\n**False Hypothesis:**\n- Assume the incident does NOT belong to this category. Justify based on the lack of evidence.\n- The description focuses on the *potential* for SNMP abuse, rather than a specific, actively deployed attack. While SNMP can be exploited, the description doesn't point to the malicious intent typically associated with ransomware or other malware.\n\n**Final Classification Decision:**\nCategory: CAT2\nExplanation: The incident describes a potential attack targeting network devices (specifically SNMP) with the intent of exploiting it for malicious purposes, fitting the definition of malware/ransomware.  The mention of the potential for DDoS amplification, combined with the specific focus on SNMP, reinforces this classification.\n",
