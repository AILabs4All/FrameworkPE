We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_2002177763])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

    "response": "Based on the incident details provided, the classification of this cybersecurity event falls into Category: CAT12. This categorization reflects an unauthorized attempt to utilize a target host for an attack—specifically, in this case, it involves DDoS attacks that caused network saturation and packet loss for clients due to the remote IP address ([IP_ADDRESS_423202de2f]).\n\n**Classification Example:**\n\nCategory: CAT12  \nExplanation: The intrusion attempt category (CAT12) is chosen because the incident involved a connection between an external host and the target, which led to significant traffic saturation and potential disruption of services for the network's client. This type of attack requires remote access to a system, which is evident in this scenario where the attack originated from an external IP address and utilized bandwidth to overwhelm the target, thus qualifying as unauthorized modification of resources for another purpose.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The incident was detected through automated responses sent by CERT.br, a coordinating team for Brazilian network incidents, indicating a coordinated multi-agent approach.\n- The attack involved an estimated Nx10Gbps bandwidth usage and exhibited behavior consistent with DDoS attacks, which are characterized by their sudden peak traffic followed by substantial latency drops as the attack propagates across the network.\n- The nature of this incident highlights the importance of proactive threat detection and response mechanisms that can identify and mitigate such remote-source threats effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, the classification aligns with the detailed analysis required to understand and respond to cybersecurity incidents involving unauthorized use of targeted systems for attacks, thereby addressing the request's criteria for categorization according to NIST guidelines.",

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP.

    "response": "Given the technical nature and security implications of the provided incident, it is crucial to categorize this event according to NIST guidelines. This classification helps in understanding the type of threat, its impact, and the appropriate response strategy. \n\n### Incident: \"Multiple failed SSH login attempts detected from external IP 192.168.1.100\"\n**Category: CAT12**\n- **Explanation:** This incident involves unauthorized access via SSH, specifically through brute force attacks. The use of external IPs for such activity is indicative of an intrusion attempt that may be disrupting the system's availability and resources. It poses a significant risk to the organization's data integrity and operational continuity, as well as potential liability if sensitive information is compromised.\n\n### Incident: \"Ransomware detected on workstation, files encrypted with .crypto extension\"\n**Category: CAT2**\n- **Explanation:** This incident indicates a malware infection. Ransomware specifically targets workstations by encrypting files and holding them hostage until a ransom is paid. The presence of the `.crypto` file extension suggests that the encryption method used is sophisticated enough to evade detection and decryption tools currently available on the market. \n\n### Incident: \"Employee accessed and downloaded customer database without authorization\"\n**Category: CAT6**\n- **Explanation:** This scenario describes an insider abuse incident. An employee, likely with access rights that are not strictly enforced, has misused this privilege to illicitly access and download confidential data. Insider threats pose a significant risk as they can compromise organizational policies, business operations, and sensitive information stored within the company's systems.\n\n### Incident: \"Unauthorized modification of system files or databases\"\n**Category: CAT8**\n- **Explanation:** This category encompasses unauthorized physical access to critical data storage devices or hardware systems. Given that the data resides on a physical machine with specific access rights, this incident highlights a serious breach in control over the organization's IT infrastructure. The impact could range from downtime and operational disruption to full-scale compromise of the systems if not promptly addressed.\n\n### Incident: \"Unauthorized access to critical systems for purposes other than authorized\"\n**Category: CAT9**\n- **Explanation:** Unauthorized use of resources, in this case, cryptocurrency mining, represents misuse that goes beyond legitimate usage rights. Cryptocurrency mining requires significant computational power and network bandwidth, making it a resource-intensive task. Organizations should ensure that their infrastructure is only utilized for its intended functions to avoid unnecessary strain on the system and potential legal implications.\n\n### Incident: \"Third-party vendor service breaches\"\n**Category: CAT11**\n- **Explanation:** This incident involves a security failure by a third party, in this case, a SaaS provider or another software supplier that failed to adequately secure its systems. Such failures can expose sensitive data and vulnerabilities, leading to potential breaches of confidentiality, integrity, or availability for the organization using those services. The specific service breach could have significant ramifications if it exposes user data, organizational processes, or critical business operations.\n\n### Incident: \"Denial of Service Attack\"\n**Category: CAT3**\n- **Explanation:** This category includes denial of service attacks, such as volumetric DDoS, SYN flood, and HTTP/HTTPS attacks. These types of incidents aim to make a system or network inaccessible to users by overwhelming it with traffic. In the case provided, an attack is described that resulted in significant bandwidth consumption, potentially disrupting services for the affected organizations until the assailants are identified and apprehended.\n\n### Incident: \"Data Leak\"\n**Category: CAT5**\n- **Explanation:** This category involves unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. The example given refers to a database theft incident where confidential information was accessed and disclosed without authorization. Such leaks can lead to severe consequences, including regulatory penalties, legal repercussions for the exposed parties, and damage to an organization's reputation.\n\n### Incident: \"Vulnerability Exploitation\"\n**Category: CAT6**\n- **Explanation:** This incident involves using technical flaws for attacks, such as CVE exploitation or SQL injection. These exploits can be used to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or perform other malicious activities within the systems. The specific vulnerability exploited here suggests that a critical system component, in this case, a database, has been compromised, allowing potential attackers to potentially execute further harmful actions.\n\n### Incident: \"Insider Abuse\"\n**Category: CAT7**\n- **Explanation:** Insider abuse refers to unauthorized activities performed by an internal user with access rights not strictly adhered to within the organization's policies. In this case, the employee accesses and downloads confidential data without authorization. Such actions can lead to severe legal and ethical implications, depending on the scale of misuse and potential harm caused.\n\n### Incident: \"Social Engineering\"\n**Category: CAT8**\n- **Explanation:** This category involves deception for gaining access or data. In this instance, a phishing attempt was described where an employee obtained access to the organization's database by posing as someone with privileged access. Such social engineering tactics can be highly effective in bypassing traditional security measures and exploiting human vulnerabilities.\n\n### Incident: \"Physical Incident\"\n**Category: CAT8**\n- **Explanation:** This category involves unauthorized physical access to critical systems or data storage devices, such as laptop theft or a breach of the organization's data center. The incident specifically mentions laptop theft in this context, which is a severe security breach impacting both the immediate and long-term operational capabilities of an organization.\n\n### Incident: \"Unauthorized Modification of Systems or Data\"\n**Category: CAT8**\n- **Explanation:** Unauthorized modification refers to any form of change that occurs outside the authorized processes of the system, typically involving data corruption or deletion. This could include actions like defacement or record manipulation. Given the specific mention of the organization having mDNS enabled devices, this incident underscores a potential vulnerability where improper changes can compromise network configuration and lead to significant operational issues.\n\n### Incident: \"Third-Party Vendor Issue\"\n**Category: CAT12**\n- **Explanation:** This category encompasses security failures by suppliers that may not have implemented adequate safeguards against attacks. Given the reference to a service mDNS being utilized across multiple devices without proper configuration, this situation highlights a potential security risk if not managed correctly. The failure could affect how these devices are used or monitored in terms of DDoS attacks, underscoring the need for supplier security practices and vigilance.\n\n### Incident: \"Intrusion Attempt\"\n**Category: CAT12**\n- **Explanation:** Although not fully described in detail, this category is indicative of unconfirmed attacks that may be undetected but are present on the network. The term 'unconfirmed attack' suggests an incident where security measures failed to detect an attempted breach, potentially leaving the system or data exposed. This category implies a need for robust monitoring and response protocols to address any detected anomalies promptly.\n\n### **Final Classification:**\n- **Category: CAT12**\n  - **Explanation:** The classification indicates that the incident falls under unauthorized access incidents using network scanning capabilities, highlighting potential security risks in the organization's infrastructure without proper configuration or monitoring.\n\nThis comprehensive classification helps in understanding and addressing the threats identified through the incident, guiding future prevention strategies and responses to similar events within the organization.",
