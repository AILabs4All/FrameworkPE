It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems.

The IP addresses listed are identified as NTP servers, which can be exploited in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. When these servers receive malformed requests like \"monlist\" or \"readvar,\" they generate significantly larger responses than the actual request, potentially causing significant network congestion and resource consumption. This misuse can lead to disruptions for third parties relying on the same network infrastructure. The primary focus is on preventing such abuse, rather than unauthorized access (CAT1) or data breaches (CAT4). Therefore, this incident falls under NIST Category CAT3, which covers Denial of Service Attacks that make systems unavailable by exploiting vulnerabilities in protocols like NTP.",

The focus is on event scheduling, pricing, location details, and registration instructions, which do not align with the characteristics of other NIST categories such as account compromise (CAT1), malware (CAT2), denial-of-service attacks (CAT3), data leak (CAT4), vulnerability exploitation (CAT5), insider abuse (CAT6), social engineering (CAT7), physical incidents (CAT8), unauthorized modifications (CAT9), misuse of resources (CAT10), third-party issues (CAT11), or intrusion attempts (CAT12).

    "response": "Category: CAT3\nExplanation: The incident description pertains to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack vulnerability, specifically targeting devices using SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). SNMP, when accessible via UDP on the internet, can be exploited for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks through a technique known as UDP-based amplification. This occurs because an attacker forges the source IP address of the victim and sends it to devices with SNMP enabled. The server then responds with a much larger packet, overwhelming the targeted system.\n\nIn this scenario, CERT.br is notifying organizations whose network devices utilize SNMP (potentially as routers or CPEs) because these systems might be unintentionally part of such amplification attacks against third parties, resulting in resource consumption and impact on other networks. To address the issue, they advise disabling or restricting the SNMP service to local networks only when not in use. This directly links back to the DoS/DDoS category because it deals with prevention of network disruptions caused by attackers misusing legitimate services.",

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP. Caso o serviço Portmap seja\n   desnecessário nesse servidor, recomendamos que ele seja desativado.\n\n4.

This is evident from the following points:\n- Portmap is used for mapping services such as NIS and NFS within Unix systems, primarily for local network file sharing.\n- The fact that this service can be exploited to conduct Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by using amplification, where an attacker sends forged requests via the victim's IP address, causing the Portmap server to return a much larger response. This could lead to excessive network traffic and potential impact on third parties.\n- The organization is alerted about servers that have Portmap enabled with the intention of either restricting its access to the local network or disabling it entirely if it’s not in use, indicating precautionary measures against such vulnerabilities potentially leading to a DoS attack.",

    "response": "Category: CAT3\nExplanation: The incident description describes a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically focusing on an exploit related to the Multicast DNS (mDNS) service used for host name resolution in local networks. This is evident from the following points:\n\n1. **Service Abuse**: mDNS can be abused by attackers to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using amplification techniques via UDP. In this case, an attacker could send forged requests targeting a victim's IP address and exploit legitimate devices running the mDNS service on local networks to amplify the traffic, causing a denial-of-service condition on the target network.\n\n2. **Targeted Networks**: The focus is on networks where the mDNS service is enabled but should not be publicly accessible. This implies that the incident targets potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities allowing attackers to exploit local networks.\n\n3. **Potential Impact**: Disabling or restricting the mDNS service prevents adversaries from using it as a vector for amplification-based DDoS attacks, thereby protecting against such denials of service.\n\nThus, based on these details, this event is classified under NIST Category CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.",

    "response": "Category: CAT3\nExplanation: The incident involves a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack using the SNMP service. SNMP can be exploited in UDP-based amplification attacks, where an attacker sends forged requests to a victim's IP address and forces devices with SNMP enabled (like routers or IoT devices) to return much larger responses, potentially causing network congestion or service disruptions. This is consistent with Category 3: Denial of Service Attack, as it describes situations where systems are intentionally made unavailable by overwhelming them with traffic.",

    "response": "Category: CAT3 (Denial of Service Attack)\nExplanation: The incident description details an incident related to a potential Distributed Denial of Service (DDoSS) attack via the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP can be exploited to conduct DDoS attacks by sending forged requests to the target's network, which then returns significantly larger responses. This behavior is indicative of an attempt to overwhelm the target network with excessive traffic, thereby denying legitimate access or service. The CERT.br organization has detected and alerted the responsible parties about devices with SNMP enabled on their networks that might be vulnerable to such attacks. The incident description includes steps to mitigate this risk, emphasizing the potential for harm to network performance due to DDoS exploitation of SNMP services.",
