SNMP abuse. SNMP is being used in a network management protocol devices like routers switches, printers. It's running on UDP can cause DoS attacks.\nD attacks consuming resources. They ask to disable the device or disable the service. The user to fix by configure SNMP properly or restrict it or block it.\nCategories. So it's denial of service attack.\n\nLooking at the description. So CAT3: Denial Service making unavailable. DoS. Examples DoS UDP flood yes. It's matching.\n\nBut wait description is SNMP abuse but.

CAT3 examples DoS DoS.\n\nBut CAT3 is specific for volumetric DoS UDP floods etc.\n\nIs this is SNMP based on SNMP amplification it's different type of DoS but still denial.\n\nCode description is same resource consumption.\n\nPerhaps CAT5 vulnerability abuse.\n\nBut CAT5 is exploitation flaws.\n\nCAT5 is exploitation.\n\nBut exploitation of flaw.

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior.

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP.

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP.

The categories for username pass \"win password SSH brute force in CAT2 SSH is under CAT0 SSH brute force token theft in the list. Wait categories SSH brute. Category code access is in CAT1 unauthorized administrator examples phishing brute SSH brute force perfect. So that fits. \n\nAlso other categories like malware or data leak denial? No not seen logs show data stolen or modification just attack. \n\nSo CAT2 SSH brute force attack is CAT1 right. But wait CAT2 SSH brute force is under CAT1? Let's see list CAT2: \n1 is \"Compromise unauthorized user credential phishing SSH brute or token CAT2. SSH yes. Yes SSH brute force is in examples under CAT. \n\nAnswer CAT1.

The categories for username pass \"win password SSH brute force in CAT2 SSH is under CAT0 SSH brute force token theft in the list. Wait categories SSH brute.

No not seen logs show data stolen or modification just attack. \n\nSo CAT2 SSH brute force attack is CAT1 right. But wait CAT2 SSH brute force is under CAT1? Let's see list CAT2: \n1 is \"Compromise unauthorized user credential phishing SSH brute or token CAT2. SSH yes. Yes SSH brute force is in examples under CAT. \n\nAnswer CAT1.
