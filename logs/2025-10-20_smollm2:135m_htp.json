We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_2002177763])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems.

There are no known consequences for this incident other than potential damage to your network infrastructure and privacy concerns among users.\n\n2.

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior.

It provides authentication logic such as SIS tables which have an added requirement for a specific username/password combination, however all users must be logged into the table.\n\nThe access control system has three layers \n- The server layer with user authentication protocols. \n- The client layer where any type of data is received from the servers so it can be processed by application; \n - This process allows the data to be stored and accessed in a manner that adheres to the rules of the Access Control System.",

In this case, it means the explanation for the classification decision states that \"the True Hypothesis is SUPPORTED\", but doesn't explicitly state which specific type of hypothesis is being suggested by the statement (Category: CAT4).\n- \"NOT SUPPORTED\": If you find the True Hypothesis mentioned as supported in the original explanation, then there might not be anything to support it.
