These failed authentication attempts, characterized by invalid usernames and password failures, align with behaviors indicative of someone trying to gain unauthorized access to the system. Since there is no explicit evidence of a successful account compromise or exploitation of a known vulnerability (as seen in CAT1 and CAT5 respectively), CAT12, which covers unconfirmed attacks and intrusion attempts, is the most appropriate classification. The repeated failed login attempts could be a sign of brute force or automated scanning activity, typical of CAT12 incidents.",

The repeated failed authentication attempts suggest an ongoing or repeated intrusion attempt, rather than a confirmed account compromise (CAT1) or other categories that require successful unauthorized access or actions. The failed password attempts for invalid users indicate that someone is trying to gain unauthorized access but is not succeeding, which aligns with the definition of an Intrusion Attempt.",

    "response": "### Incident Categorization\n\n**Category: CAT5 - Vulnerability Exploitation**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe incident description details repeated attempts to gain unauthorized access via SSH with invalid user credentials from a specific IP address `[IP_ADDRESS_b29a075d57]`. This suggests that the attacker is exploiting vulnerabilities in the SSH service by attempting to brute force access using various invalid usernames and passwords. The repeated failed login attempts, as logged by Fail2Ban, indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the SSH service configuration or implementation, which allows such unauthorized access attempts to occur.

    "response": "Category: CAT12\nExplanation: This incident falls under Category 12 (Intrusion Attempt) because it describes multiple failed login attempts to SSH from a single IP address, which suggests an automated or scripted intrusion attempt. The attempted logins use invalid usernames, indicating that the intruder is likely trying to gain access by brute force or scanning techniques without specific target credentials, which are classic signs of an intrusion attempt. Additionally, the absence of successful authentication in these logs points towards an attempt that was unsuccessful, fitting the criteria for an intrusion attempt rather than a successful exploit or account compromise.",

    "response": "### Incident Analysis\n\n**Category:** CAT5 - Vulnerability Exploitation\n\n**Explanation:** The incident involves repeated failed login attempts from an IP address, suggesting a brute force attack or automated scanning for vulnerabilities. This is akin to exploiting a vulnerability in the system's authentication mechanism, which aligns with Category 5. The logs indicate numerous failed login attempts using different user credentials, hinting at automated tools attempting to gain unauthorized access.\n\n**Justification:** Category 5 is selected because the evidence points towards an automated process attempting to exploit the SSH service on the target system by trying multiple invalid usernames and passwords. This is a clear example of using a technical flaw (weak or non-existent authentication controls) for attacks, which is the core definition of Vulnerability Exploitation in NIST's categorization. The repeated failures to authenticate suggest an attempt to bypass security measures, typical in vulnerability exploitation scenarios.",

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP.
