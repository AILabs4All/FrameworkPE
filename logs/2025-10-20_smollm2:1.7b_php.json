We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_2002177763])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems.

    "response": "### Answer:\n\nThe incident description involves a security expert verifying and classifying near-critical incidents requiring immediate attention. The most appropriate NIST classification is CAT1, which stands for Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts. This incident falls under this category because the described IPs are servers NTP malconfigured, which pose potential risks of account compromise through credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft, and more.\n\nThe explanation justifies this classification based on the described attacks affecting potential vulnerabilities in user authentication systems. The security expert has also received reports from other organizations indicating these IPs are being used in DDoS activities against third-party services, which further supports the account compromise nature of the incidents.",

O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior. Além dessas implicações, esse serviço pode revelar\n   informações sensíveis sobre sua rede e seus dados armazenados.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n   para ataques DDoS podem ser encontradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n3. Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nConfigure o serviço Portmap de forma que ele seja acessível somente\n   aos dispositivos de sua rede, que utilizem esse serviço, ou que ele\n   seja acessível apenas via TCP. Caso o serviço Portmap seja\n   desnecessário nesse servidor, recomendamos que ele seja desativado.\n\n4.

    "response": "### Step 1: Analyze the incident description to categorize it under a specific NIST catagory.\n\nThe incident details a situation where certain IP addresses are involved in SNMP operations, indicating potential abuse of this service by external parties that could disrupt services or impact third-parties through bandwidth consumption. The explanation points out how these IPs can be found on servers and other connected devices, which is related to unauthorized access to internal resources, such as data centers and server usage for malicious purposes.\n\n### Step 2: Choose the most appropriate NIST category based on the incident description and its implications.\n\nBased on the information provided in the incident description and explanation, I classify it under Category 3 - Denial of Service Attack (DoS/DDoS). This is because the described situation involves potential abuse of SNMP by external parties to make systems unavailable or impact services provided over the network, which are key characteristics of a DoS attack.\n\n### Step 3: Provide an explanation for the chosen NIST category.\n\n\"Denial of Service Attack (DoS/DDoS) is a type of cyber threat where an attacker utilizes available resources and malicious code to exhaust or overload the capabilities of a system, network, service, or device to prevent legitimate users from accessing them. This can be achieved through various means such as sending large amounts of traffic to disrupt network functionality, leveraging compromised machines for brute force attacks (DoS), or using social engineering tactics like phishing to acquire credentials and manipulate services.\"\n\n### Step 4: Return the categorized incident with its explanation.\n\nCategory: 3: Denial of Service Attack (DoS/DDoS)\nExplanation: As described in this scenario, potential abuse of SNMP by external parties could disrupt systems or impact services provided over the network due to their large-scale malicious traffic consumption and exploit capabilities on internal resources for attack purposes.",
