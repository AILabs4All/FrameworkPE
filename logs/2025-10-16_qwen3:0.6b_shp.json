    "response": "**Category:** CAT1  \n**Explanation:** The incident describes a machine sending SSH brute-force attacks, indicating a compromised credential (likely via phishing or social engineering). The CERT.br is investigating unauthorized access, which aligns with **Account Compromise** (CAT1), as SSH brute force exploits unauthorized access to user or administrator credentials.  \n\n**Justification:**  \n- **SSH brute force** is a form of **account compromise** by leveraging stolen credentials.  \n- The explanation emphasizes that the machine is being used for malicious activities, which directly relates to unauthorized access.  \n- No other NIST categories (e.g., Malware, Denial of Service) apply to this incident.",

This directly falls under **Account Compromise** (CAT1) as it involves unauthorized access through a compromised authentication method (SSH). The attack is a clear example of exploiting a technical flaw in the SSH protocol, aligning with NIST’s definition of Account Compromise.  \n\n**Justification:**  \n- **CAT1** specifically targets unauthorized access to accounts or systems via authentication vulnerabilities.  \n- The log demonstrates **brute-force attacks** on SSH, which is a classic example of such exploits, directly tied to weak authentication practices.  \n\nThis classification aligns with the incident’s core issue of exploiting a technical vulnerability.",

    "response": "**Category:** CAT1: Account Compromise – Unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.  \n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe incident involves multiple instances of invalid users attempting to log in via SSH, which indicates a **brute force** attack targeting the account. This directly relates to unauthorized access to credentials (e.g., usernames or passwords), which aligns with the definition of **account compromise**. The repeated attempts suggest a breach of confidentiality, which is a common entry point for unauthorized access.  \n\nOther categories may be relevant, but the primary focus here is on unauthorized user access through technical means, making **Account Compromise** the most accurate classification.",

    "response": "**Category: CAT3 - Denial of Service Attack**  \n**Explanation:**  \nThe incident involves a vulnerability in the Portmap service (UDP-based) being exposed to the Internet, which could be exploited for **DDoS attacks**. Portmap, typically used for local network services like RPC, is not traditionally used in local networks. If enabled, it could be abused to amplify requests via UDP, creating a flood of traffic that overwhelms systems. This violates security policies by allowing unrestricted access to public-facing services, leading to possible **denial of service** attacks. The best action is to disable the Portmap service to only use TCP, which blocks its exposure to external networks, preventing exploitation.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe incident directly falls under **CAT3** because it involves unauthorized service exploitation leading to system-wide resource overload (DDoS) attacks. The explanation highlights the attack vector (UDP amplification) and the potential for data leaks or unauthorized use, aligning with the denial-of-service principle.",

Such actions exploit vulnerabilities in authentication protocols, leading to unauthorized access to the system.  \n\n**Justification:**  \n- **Credential brute force**: The logs show consistent, repeated attempts to connect to an SSH server, which aligns with a vulnerability where attackers use weak credentials to gain unauthorized access.  \n- **System exploitation**: The CERT team is responding by collaborating to investigate the incident, which highlights the need for authentication and access control measures.  \n\nThis incident directly relates to **account compromise** (CAT1), as it involves unauthorized access through a credential-based attack.",

Este serviço\npode ser abusado para fazer parte de ataques distribuídos de negação\nde serviço, consumindo recursos da sua rede e impactando terceiros.\n\nLembramos que os endereços IP listados, além de servidores e\ncomputadores, também podem ser de dispositivos de rede com o serviço\nSNMP habilitado, como roteadores, impressoras, CPEs (modem ou roteador\nde uso doméstico instalado nos clientes), entre outros.\n\nGostaríamos de solicitar que:\n\n* o servico SNMP seja configurado corretamente ou desabilitado no\n   equipamento, caso não esteja em uso.\n\nUma descrição do problema e possíveis soluções podem ser encontradas\nno final deste documento.\n\nSe você não for a pessoa correta para corrigir o problema destes\nequipamentos com o serviço SNMP habilitado, por favor repasse essa\nmensagem para alguém de sua organização que possa fazê-lo.\n\nO indicador no campo 'Resultados do Teste' indica o tipo de problema\ntestado e significa:\n\n* snmp: status/pacotes/bytes, onde status é \"open\", e pacotes/bytes\n   indicam o tamanho da resposta recebida, em pacotes/bytes.\n\n====================================================================================\nEndereco IP      | ASN    | Status | Data do Teste        | Resultados do Teste\n[IP_ADDRESS_c8174cb77f]    | 2716   | OPEN   | 2022-05-09T11:16:07Z | snmp: open/1/211\n[IP_ADDRESS_514c3637fc]   | 2716   | OPEN   | 2022-05-09T11:16:07Z | snmp: open/1/140\n[IP_ADDRESS_7d3c82ab0a]     | 2716   | OPEN   | 2022-05-09T11:16:14Z | snmp: open/1/215\n====================================================================================\nMais detalhes sobre o porque do envio desta mensagem, quem é o\nCERT.br e como resolver este problema estão listados abaixo.\n\nCordialmente,\n-- \nCERT.br\n<[EMAIL_ADDRESS_83824c64b2]>\n[URL_ea4f5d47bf]\n\n* O que é o serviço SNMP (161/udp)?\n\nO SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) é um protocolo de rede\n  utilizado para gerenciamento e diagnóstico de dispositivos de redes.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n  ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com SNMP retorna uma resposta muito maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço SNMP pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de\n  implicar em um consumo de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nSe o SNMP não for utilizado na sua rede desabilite o serviço no seu\n  dispositivo. Se o recurso for utilizado na rede local, configure-o\n  de modo que esteja disponível apenas para a rede local.\n\nEvite utilizar comunidades public e se possível utilize autenticação\n  quando disponível.\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  SNMP para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n    [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um dispositivo vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de dispositivos\n  que usam SNMP que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n  ataques distribuídos de negação de serviços (DDoS).  O [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está\n  notificando os responsáveis pelos dispositivos brasileiros presentes\n  nestas listas.\n\n* Como posso ter certeza que resolvi o problema?\n\nVocê pode verificar seu dispositivo atravás dos seguintes comandos:\n  (preferencialmente execute-os a partir da Internet, ou seja, fora de\n  uma rede interna que tenha permissão de acesso ao dispositivo).\n\n$ snmpget -v 2c]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n         **Category:** CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable  \n**Explanation:** The incident involves a vulnerability in the SNMP protocol (161/UDP) that allows unauthorized access to network devices. When SNMP services are enabled, they can be exploited for **UDP-based amplification attacks** (DDoS), where attackers use forged IP addresses to overwhelm networks. This attack leverages the SNMP service's ability to return larger response sizes than requested, enabling the amplification of malicious traffic (e.g., DDoS). The explanation aligns with NIST category 3, which categorizes such attacks as a denial-of-service attack.
