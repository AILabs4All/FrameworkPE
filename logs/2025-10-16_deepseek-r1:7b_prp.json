However, there's an additional consideration with a hypothesis suggesting it could be categorized under CAT3.\n\nTo determine the value of X in the Incident (SYN flood), we need to understand how the categorization system assigns values. Given that SYN flooding is typically related to attack vectors or methods used, and without further details on their specific categorization subcategories, it's challenging to assign an exact numerical value.\n\nHowever, based on standard NIST categories:\n- **CAT5 (EXPLOITATION)** fits the scenario of vulnerability exploitation.\n- If considering additional subcategories, SYN flooding might fall under Mitigation (CAT4) if it relates to measures taken to prevent such attacks.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about their categorization system's structure and subcategories, assigning a precise value to X is not feasible.

Este serviço\npode ser abusado para fazer parte de ataques distribuídos de negação\nde serviço, consumindo recursos da sua rede e impactando terceiros.\n\nLembramos que os endereços IP listados, além de servidores e\ncomputadores, também podem ser de dispositivos de rede com o serviço\nSNMP habilitado, como roteadores, impressoras, CPEs (modem ou roteador\nde uso doméstico instalado nos clientes), entre outros.\n\nGostaríamos de solicitar que:\n\n* o servico SNMP seja configurado corretamente ou desabilitado no\n   equipamento, caso não esteja em uso.\n\nUma descrição do problema e possíveis soluções podem ser encontradas\nno final deste documento.\n\nSe você não for a pessoa correta para corrigir o problema destes\nequipamentos com o serviço SNMP habilitado, por favor repasse essa\nmensagem para alguém de sua organização que possa fazê-lo.\n\nO indicador no campo 'Resultados do Teste' indica o tipo de problema\ntestado e significa:\n\n* snmp: status/pacotes/bytes, onde status é \"open\", e pacotes/bytes\n   indicam o tamanho da resposta recebida, em pacotes/bytes.\n\n====================================================================================\nEndereco IP      | ASN    | Status | Data do Teste        | Resultados do Teste\n[IP_ADDRESS_c8174cb77f]    | 2716   | OPEN   | 2022-05-09T11:16:07Z | snmp: open/1/211\n[IP_ADDRESS_514c3637fc]   | 2716   | OPEN   | 2022-05-09T11:16:07Z | snmp: open/1/140\n[IP_ADDRESS_7d3c82ab0a]     | 2716   | OPEN   | 2022-05-09T11:16:14Z | snmp: open/1/215\n====================================================================================\nMais detalhes sobre o porque do envio desta mensagem, quem é o\nCERT.br e como resolver este problema estão listados abaixo.\n\nCordialmente,\n-- \nCERT.br\n<[EMAIL_ADDRESS_83824c64b2]>\n[URL_ea4f5d47bf]\n\n* O que é o serviço SNMP (161/udp)?\n\nO SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) é um protocolo de rede\n  utilizado para gerenciamento e diagnóstico de dispositivos de redes.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n  ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com SNMP retorna uma resposta muito maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço SNMP pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de\n  implicar em um consumo de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nSe o SNMP não for utilizado na sua rede desabilite o serviço no seu\n  dispositivo. Se o recurso for utilizado na rede local, configure-o\n  de modo que esteja disponível apenas para a rede local.\n\nEvite utilizar comunidades public e se possível utilize autenticação\n  quando disponível.\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  SNMP para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n    [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um dispositivo vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de dispositivos\n  que usam SNMP que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n  ataques distribuídos de negação de serviços (DDoS).  O [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está\n  notificando os responsáveis pelos dispositivos brasileiros presentes\n  nestas listas.\n\n* Como posso ter certeza que resolvi o problema?\n\nVocê pode verificar seu dispositivo atravás dos seguintes comandos:\n  (preferencialmente execute-os a partir da Internet, ou seja, fora de\n  uma rede interna que tenha permissão de acesso ao dispositivo).\n\n$ snmpget -v 2c]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n        \n        Replace all occurrences of the word 'unspecified' with 'X' in a given text. \n        Ensure that the substitution preserves the original context and sentence structure.\n        ",
