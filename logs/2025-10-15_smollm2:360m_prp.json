O que é o serviço Portmap (111/udp)?\n\nO serviço Portmap, também chamado de Portmapper ou rpcbind, é\n   utilizado para mapear serviços RPC na rede, como NIS e NFS. Esse\n   serviço geralmente é utilizado por sistemas Unix, especialmente para\n   compartilhamento de arquivos, além de outros serviços.\n\nPor se tratar de um serviço geralmente utilizado apenas dentro de\n   redes locais, é muito provável que não exista necessidade do serviço\n   Portmap estar exposto à Internet.\n\nCaso esteja acessível a toda a Internet via UDP, esse serviço pode\n   ser explorado para ataques DDoS que usem amplificação. Isto ocorre\n   porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n   servidor com Portmap retorna uma resposta muito maior que a\n   requisição.\n\n2. Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO Portmap pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros, envolvendo\n   sua rede em ataques a outras organizações e implicando em um consumo\n   de banda maior.

    "response": "Based on the provided incident description, here's a categorization of the incident based on NIST categories:\n\n- CAT1 (Account Compromise): unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts. Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force.\n\n- CAT2 (Malware): infection by malicious code. Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n\n- CAT3 (Denial of Service Attack): making systems unavailable. Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites.\n\n- CAT4 (Data Leak): unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n\n- CAT5 (Vulnerability Exploitation): using technical flaws for attacks. Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n\n- CAT6 (Insider Abuse): malicious actions by internal users. Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n\n- CAT7 (Social Engineering): deception to gain access or data. Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n\n- CAT8 (Physical Incident): impact due to unauthorized physical access. Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n\n- Catastrophe Event is not a well-defined category in NIST categories but could be classified under other related types of incidents like Third-Party Issues or Intrusion Attempts. The best classification would depend on the incident description and its level of severity.\n\nCategory: [NIST code] Explanation: If no suitable categorization is available, this could potentially fall into any of the categories mentioned above (Cat7-8), which are not well-defined in NIST Categories but might include similar types of incidents like Third-Party Issues or Intrusion Attempts under Cat6. However, based on the provided description, it seems more suitable to categorize it as either Cat4 (Data Leak) or Cat5 (Malware).",

Isto ocorre\n  porque o atacante envia uma requisição forjando o IP da vítima e o\n  servidor com SNMP retorna uma resposta muito maior que a requisição.\n\n* Por que devo me preocupar com isso?\n\nO serviço SNMP pode ser abusado para causar danos a terceiros,\n  envolvendo sua rede em ataques a outras organizações, além de\n  implicar em um consumo de banda maior.\n\nInformações adicionais sobre como evitar que sua rede seja abusada\n  para este e outros ataques DDoS podem ser econtradas aqui:\n\n[URL_eebddb46c5]\n\n* Como faço para corrigir o problema?\n\nSe o SNMP não for utilizado na sua rede desabilite o serviço no seu\n  dispositivo. Se o recurso for utilizado na rede local, configure-o\n  de modo que esteja disponível apenas para a rede local.\n\nEvite utilizar comunidades public e se possível utilize autenticação\n  quando disponível.\n\n* Onde posso obter informações adicionais sobre o abuso do protocolo\n  SNMP para ataques DDoS?\n\n- UDP-Based Amplification Attacks\n    [URL_f1b488990d]\n\n* Como o [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] sabe que este é um dispositivo vulnerável?\n\nO [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está recebendo notificações com listas de dispositivos\n  que usam SNMP que possivelmente estão sendo abusados e utilizados em\n  ataques distribuídos de negação de serviços (DDoS).  O [ORGANIZATION_54947c67d4] está\n  notificando os responsáveis pelos dispositivos brasileiros presentes\n  nestas listas.\n\n* Como posso ter certeza que resolvi o problema?\n\nVocê pode verificar seu dispositivo atravás dos seguintes comandos:\n  (preferencialmente execute-os a partir da Internet, ou seja, fora de\n  uma rede interna que tenha permissão de acesso ao dispositivo).\n\n$ snmpget -v 2c]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n        \n        Replace all occurrences of the word 'unknown' with 'X' in a given text. \n        Ensure that the substitution preserves the original context and sentence structure.\n        ",
