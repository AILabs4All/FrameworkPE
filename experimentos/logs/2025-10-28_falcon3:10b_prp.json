The lack of successful account compromise at the time of reporting further supports this classification.",

The logs provided show repeated attempts by the IP address [IP_ADDRESS_984299dc8f] to connect to the mail server, resulting in rejections due to all server ports being busy and the server disconnecting after data attempts. These actions indicate a potential volumetric DoS or DDoS attack, where the attacker is overwhelming the server with connection requests, making it unavailable for legitimate use. The repeated failed connections and rejections suggest an attempt to exhaust server resources, which is a classic characteristic of a DoS/DDoS attack.",

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.\n\nThis i]\n            ```\n        \n        NIST Categories Available for Classification:\n        - CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n            Examples: credential phishing, SSH brute force, OAuth token theft.\n        - CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code.\n            Examples: ransomware, Trojan horse, macro virus.\n        - CAT3: Denial of Service Attack – making systems unavailable.\n            Examples: volumetric DoS or DDoS (UDP flood, SYN flood, HTTP, HTTPS), attack on publicly available APIs or websites, botnet Mirai attacking an institution's server.\n        - CAT4: Data Leak – unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.\n            Examples: database theft, leaked credentials.\n        - CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks.\n            Examples: exploitation of critical CVE, remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection in web applications.\n        - CAT6: Insider Abuse – malicious actions by internal users.\n            Examples: copying confidential data, sabotage.\n        - CAT7: Social Engineering – deception to gain access or data.\n            Examples: phishing, vishing, CEO fraud.\n        - CAT8: Physical Incident – impact due to unauthorized physical access.\n            Examples: laptop theft, data center break-in.\n        - CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes to systems or data.\n            Examples: defacement, record manipulation.\n        - CAT10: Misuse of Resources – unauthorized use for other purposes.\n            Examples: cryptocurrency mining, malware distribution.\n        - CAT11: Third-Party Issues – security failures by suppliers.\n            Examples: SaaS breach, supply chain attack.\n        - CAT12: Intrusion Attempt – unconfirmed attacks.\n            Examples: network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.\n\n        Your task:\n        - Classify the incident below using the most appropriate category code (CAT1 to CAT12).\n        - Justify based on the explanation of the selected category.\n        \n        Replace all occurrences of the word 'ddos' with 'X' in a given text. \n        Ensure that the substitution preserves the original context and sentence structure.\n        ",
