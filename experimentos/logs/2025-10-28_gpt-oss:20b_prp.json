This pattern is characteristic of a SYN‑flood denial‑of‑service attack, where the attacker overwhelms the target systems with connection requests to exhaust resources and disrupt legitimate traffic. The CERT.br notice explicitly states that the machine is “performing malicious activities” and is likely being used as a base for attacks, confirming that the activity is an active DoS attempt rather than a passive scan or other intrusion type.

The description explains how these technical flaws (e.g., the monlist and readvar commands) can be abused to launch distributed denial‑of‑service (DDoS) attacks. This is a classic example of a vulnerability that could be exploited for malicious purposes, fitting the definition of CAT5. The placeholder “X” in the text replaces the word “exploit.” \n```\n",
