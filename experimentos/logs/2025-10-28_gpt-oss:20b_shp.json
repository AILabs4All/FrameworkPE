    "response": "**Category:** **CAT12 – Intrusion Attempt**  \n**Explanation:**  \nThe incident consists of repeated failed SSH authentication attempts from a single IP address, targeting both invalid usernames and the root account. These are classic signs of a brute‑force or credential‑guessing attack aimed at gaining unauthorized access. No evidence of a successful login or subsequent compromise is provided; the logs only show authentication failures and disconnects. Therefore, the activity fits the definition of an *intrusion attempt*—an unconfirmed or thwarted attack that did not result in a confirmed account compromise. This aligns with the NIST **CAT12** description: “unconfirmed attacks such as network scans, brute force, blocked exploits.”",

    "response": "**Category:** **CAT10 – Misuse of Resources**\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe incident report is about an IP address that is repeatedly connecting to a mail server and attempting to send email traffic that is ultimately rejected or flagged as spam. The abuse is not a direct compromise of an account, a malware infection, a denial‑of‑service attack, a data leak, a vulnerability exploitation, insider wrongdoing, social engineering, physical intrusion, unauthorized modification, or a third‑party failure.  \n\nInstead, the IP is **misusing the email infrastructure** for the purpose of sending unsolicited or potentially malicious messages (spam). This falls squarely under the definition of *Misuse of Resources* – the attacker is using legitimate network resources (SMTP servers) for an illicit purpose (spam distribution). Therefore, the most appropriate NIST category for this incident is **CAT10**.",

The abuse is not a direct compromise of an account, a malware infection, a denial‑of‑service attack, a data leak, a vulnerability exploitation, insider wrongdoing, social engineering, physical intrusion, unauthorized modification, or a third‑party failure.  \n\nInstead, the IP is **misusing the email infrastructure** for the purpose of sending unsolicited or potentially malicious messages (spam). This falls squarely under the definition of *Misuse of Resources* – the attacker is using legitimate network resources (SMTP servers) for an illicit purpose (spam distribution). Therefore, the most appropriate NIST category for this incident is **CAT10**. The category is: CAT10 \n        If classification is not possible, return:\n        Category: Unknown\n        Explanation: Unknown\n        \n        OUTPUT:\n        Category: [NIST code]\n        Explanation: [Justification for the chosen category]\n        ",

    "response": "**Category:** **CAT12 – Intrusion Attempt**  \n**Explanation:**  \nThe CERT.br notification and the accompanying logs show the target machine repeatedly sending TCP SYN packets to a wide range of external IP addresses on port 3306 (the standard MySQL port). This pattern is characteristic of a network‑scan or brute‑force attempt aimed at discovering open database services. No evidence of a successful compromise, malware execution, or data exfiltration is present in the provided information. Therefore the incident best fits the “Intrusion Attempt” category, which covers unconfirmed attacks such as scans, brute‑force attempts, and blocked exploits.",

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An IPTV device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

This is an unauthorized use of the server’s resources to distribute malicious content. According to the NIST categories, CAT10 covers “unauthorized use for other purposes,” such as malware distribution or other malicious exploitation of a system’s capabilities. The activity here fits that definition better than account compromise, malware infection, DoS, data leaks, or other categories. Therefore, the most appropriate classification is **CAT10**.",
