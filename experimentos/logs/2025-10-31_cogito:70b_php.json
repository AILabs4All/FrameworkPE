    "response": "Category: CAT12\nExplanation: This incident represents an intrusion attempt (CAT12) as evidenced by multiple failed SSH login attempts from a single IP address ([IP_ADDRESS_32a64212fc]) trying different usernames including 'test5', 'rundeck', 'jimmy', and 'root'. The log entries show repeated authentication failures, which are characteristic of a brute force attack or unauthorized access attempt. Since the attempts were unsuccessful (all login attempts failed), this qualifies as an intrusion attempt rather than a successful account compromise (which would be CAT1). The incident was detected by Fail2Ban and reported to CERT.br, indicating it was blocked but still represents an attempted intrusion into the system.",

The CERT.br explicitly mentions \"a maquina foi vitima de um ataque de forca bruta contra o SSH\" (the machine was victim of a brute force attack against SSH).\n2. The logs show multiple connection attempts to port 3306 from different source ports, which is characteristic of a brute force attack trying to gain unauthorized access.\n3. The email warns that the machine might have been compromised and is being used as a base for attacks or that legitimate users might be involved in activities against acceptable use policies.\n\nThese indicators align perfectly with CAT1 (Account Compromise) as they represent attempts to gain unauthorized access through credential guessing, which is a classic example of account compromise. The SSH brute force attack is specifically mentioned as an example under the CAT1 category in the NIST guidelines.",

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An IPTV device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.\n\nIt is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us:\n\n- A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface\n- An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app\n- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel\n- A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d])\n- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363])\n- A compromised Xerox-branded device\n- Some other compromised standalone device\n- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP\n- A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation\n- A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205\n- A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability)\n\nThe overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.\n\nAttacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

The CERT.br notification warns that devices with SSDP/uPnP service enabled on UDP port 1900 can be exploited for DDoS amplification attacks, where attackers can use these vulnerable devices to amplify traffic and overwhelm target systems. The email specifically mentions that \"o serviço pode ser abusado para fazer parte de ataques distribuídos de negação de serviço\" (the service can be abused as part of distributed denial of service attacks). This aligns with CAT3's definition, which includes volumetric DoS or DDoS attacks using UDP flood. The incident is about preventing the device from being used in such attacks rather than an actual attack occurring, but it falls under CAT3 due to its direct relation to potential DDoS exploitation.",

The description indicates that an email server is being used to send fraudulent emails attempting to extort users, which is a classic example of social engineering tactics. The attackers are using deception (in this case, through email) to manipulate victims into taking actions or providing information. This aligns with the CAT7 definition of \"deception to gain access or data\" and specifically matches the example given in the NIST categories for phishing, which is a form of social engineering.\n\nThe key indicators that point to social engineering are:\n1. The mention of \"extort users\"\n2. The use of email as the attack vector\n3. The attempt to manipulate victims through fraudulent messages\n\nThis type of incident falls squarely within the realm of social engineering attacks, making CAT7 the most appropriate classification.",
